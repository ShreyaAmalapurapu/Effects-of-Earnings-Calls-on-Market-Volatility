NasdaqGS:META\nFQ1 2025 Earnings Call Transcripts\nWednesday, April 30, 2025 9:00 PM GMT\nS&P Global Market Intelligence Estimates\n\nPresentation\n\nOperator\n\nGood afternoon. My name is Krista, and I will be your conference operator\ntoday. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Meta First\nQuarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call will be\nrecorded.\n\nThank you very much. Ken Dorell, Meta's Director of Investor Relations, you\nmay begin.\n\nKenneth J. Dorell\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Meta's First Quarter 2025\nEarnings Conference Call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark\nZuckerberg, CEO; and Susan Li, CFO.\n\nOur remarks today will include forward-looking statements, which are based\non assumptions as of today. Actual results may differ materially as a\nresult of various factors, including those set forth in today's earnings\npress release and in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. We\nundertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.\n\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial\nmeasures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in\ntoday's earnings press release. The earnings press release and an\naccompanying investor presentation are available on our website at\ninvestor.atmeta.com.\n\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nAll right. Thanks, Ken. Thanks, everyone, for joining today. We've had a\nstrong start to the year. Our community keeps growing with more than 3.4\nbillion people now using at least one of our apps each day. Our business is\nalso performing very well, and I think we're well positioned to navigate\nthe macroeconomic uncertainty.\n\nThe major theme right now, of course, is how AI is transforming everything\nwe do. And as we continue to increase our investments and focus more of our\nresources on AI, I thought it would be useful today to lay out the 5 major\nopportunities that we are focused on. Those are improved advertising, more\nengaging experiences, business messaging, Meta AI and AI devices. And these\nare each long-term investments that are downstream from us building general\nintelligence and leading AI models and infrastructure. Even with our\nsignificant investments, we don't need to succeed in all of these areas to\nhave a good ROI. But if we do, then I think that we will be wildly happy\nwith the investments that we are making.\n\nThe first opportunity is improved advertising. Our goal is to make it so\nthat any business can basically tell us what objective they're trying to\nachieve like selling something or getting a new customer and how much\nthey're willing to pay for each result and then we just do the rest.\nBusinesses used to have to generate their own ad creative and define what\naudiences they wanted to reach, but AI has already made us better at\ntargeting and finding the audiences that will be interested in their\nproducts than many businesses are themselves, and that keeps improving. And\nnow AI is generating better creative options for many businesses as well.\n\nI think that this is really redefining what advertising is into an AI agent\nthat delivers measurable business results at scale. And if we deliver on\nthis vision, then over the coming years, I think that the increased\nproductivity from AI will make advertising a meaningfully larger share of\nglobal GDP than it is today. In just the last quarter, we are testing a new\nads recommendation model for Reels, which has already increased conversion\nrates by 5%. And we're seeing 30% more advertisers are using AI creative\ntools in the last quarter as well.\n\nThe second opportunity is more engaging experiences. This will come in 2\nforms: better recommendations for existing content types and better new\ntypes of content. In the last 6 months, improvements to our recommendation\nsystems have led to a 7% increase in time spent on Facebook, 6% increase on\nInstagram and 35% on Threads. Threads now also has more than 350 million\nmonthly actives and continues to be on track to become our next major\nsocial app.\n\nIn addition to better recommendations for existing content types, AI is\nalso enabling the creation of better content as well. Some of this will be\nhelping people produce better content to share themselves. Some of this\nwill be AI generating content directly for people that is personalized for\nthem. Some of this will be in existing formats like photos and videos, and\nsome of it will be increasingly interactive.\n\nI've often talked about this long-term trend of content becoming richer\nover time. Our feeds started mostly with text and then became mostly photos\nwhen we all got mobile phones with cameras and then became mostly video\nwhen mobile networks became fast enough to handle that well. We are now in\nthe video era, but I don't think that this is the end of the line. In the\nnear future, I think that we're going to have content in our feeds that you\ncan interact with and that it will interact back with you rather than you\njust watching it. Over the long term, as AI unlocks more productivity in\nthe economy, I also expect that people will spend more of their time on\nentertainment and culture, which will create an even larger opportunity to\ncreate more engaging experiences across all of these apps.\n\nThe third opportunity is business messaging. Right now, the vast majority\nof our business is advertising and feeds on Facebook and Instagram. But\nWhatsApp now has more than 3 billion monthly actives with more than 100\nmillion people in the U.S. and growing quickly there. Messenger is also\nused by more than 1 billion people each month, and there are now as many\nmessages sent each day on Instagram as there are on Messenger. So business\nmessaging should be the next pillar of our business.\n\nIn countries like Thailand and Vietnam, where there is a low cost of labor,\nwe see many businesses conduct commerce through our messaging apps. There's\nactually so much business through messaging that those countries are both\nin our top 10 or 11 by revenue even though they're ranked in the 30s in\nglobal GDP. This phenomenon hasn't yet spread to developed countries\nbecause the cost of labor is too high to make this a profitable model\nbefore AI, but AI should solve this.\n\nSo in the next few years, I expect that just like every business today has\nan e-mail address, social media account and website, they'll also have an\nAI business agent that can do customer support and sales. And they should\nbe able to set that up very easily given all the context that they've\nalready put into our business platforms. And we're going to have more to\nshare on upcoming calls about our progress in this area.\n\nThe fourth opportunity is Meta AI. Across our apps, there are now almost 1\nbillion monthly actives using Meta AI. Our focus for this year is deepening\nthe experience and making AI the leading personal AI with an emphasis on\npersonalization, voice conversations and entertainment. I think that we're\nall going to have an AI that we talk to throughout the day, while we're\nbrowsing content on our phones, and eventually, as we're going through our\ndays with glasses. And I think that this is going to be one of the most\nimportant and valuable services that has ever been created.\n\nIn addition to building Meta AI into our apps, we just released our first\nMeta AI stand-alone app. It is personalized. So you can talk to it about\ninterests that you've shown while browsing Reels or different content\nacross our apps. And we built a social feed into it. So you can discover\nentertaining ways that others are using Meta AI. And initial feedback on\nthe app has been good so far.\n\nOver time, I expect the business opportunity for Meta AI to follow our\nnormal product development playbook. First, we build and scale the product.\nAnd then once it is at scale, then we focus on revenue. In this case, I\nthink that there will be a large opportunity to show product\nrecommendations or ads as well as a premium service for people who want to\nunlock more compute for additional functionality or intelligence. But I\nexpect that we're going to be largely focused on scaling and deepening\nengagement for at least the next year before we'll really be ready to start\nbuilding out the business here.\n\nThe fifth opportunity is AI devices, which is increasingly how we are\nthinking about our work on the next generation of computing platforms.\nGlasses are the ideal form factor for both AI and the metaverse. They\nenable you to let an AI see what you see, hear what you hear and talk to\nyou throughout the day. And they let you blend the physical and digital\nworlds together with holograms.\n\nMore than 1 billion people worldwide wear glasses today, and it seems\nhighly likely that these will become AI glasses over the next 5 to 10\nyears. Building the devices that people use to experience our services lets\nus deliver the highest-quality AI and social experiences. And this will\nserve as an amplifier on all of the opportunities I've mentioned so far as\nwell as unlocking some new opportunities as well.\n\nRay-Ban Meta AI glasses have tripled in sales in the last year. The people\nwho have them are using them a lot. We've got some exciting new launches\nwith our partner, EssilorLuxottica, later this year as well that should\nexpand that category and add some new technological capabilities to the\nglasses. On Quest, we are also seeing deeper engagement as Quest 3S makes\nVR accessible to more people, and more people are creating experiences in\nhorizon with AI tools.\n\nNow everything that I've talked about today is built on top of our AI\nmodels and our infrastructure. We released the first Llama 4 models earlier\nthis month. They are some of the most intelligent, best multimodal, lowest\nlatency and most efficient models that anyone has built. We have more\nmodels on the way, including the massive Llama 4 Behemoth model.\n\nOverall, we are focused on building full general intelligence. All of the\nopportunities that I've discussed today are downstream of delivering\ngeneral intelligence and doing so efficiently. The pace of progress across\nthe industry and the opportunities ahead for us are staggering. I want to\nmake sure that we're working aggressively and efficiently. And I also want\nto make sure that we are building out the leading infrastructure and teams\nthat we need to achieve our goals.\n\nSo to that end, we are accelerating some of our efforts to bring capacity\nonline more quickly this year as well as some longer-term projects that\nwill give us the flexibility to add capacity in the coming years as well.\nAnd that has increased our planned investment for this year.\n\nMore broadly, this has been a good start to what I expect will continue to\nbe an intense year. We've got a lot more exciting work in the pipeline that\nI'm looking forward to sharing soon. I continue to think that this year is\ngoing to be a pivotal moment for our industry, and I am grateful for\neveryone who is working so hard at the company to deliver all of this\namazing technology and new experiences.\n\nAs always, thank you all for being on this journey with us. And now, Susan.\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our\nconsolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless\notherwise noted.\n\nQ1 total revenue was $42.3 billion, up 16% or 19% on a constant currency\nbasis. Q1 total expenses were $24.8 billion, up 9% compared to last year.\nIn terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased 14%, driven\nprimarily by higher infrastructure costs and payments to partners,\npartially offset by a benefit from the previously announced extension of\nserver useful lives. R&D increased 22%, mostly due to higher employee\ncompensation and infrastructure costs. Marketing and sales increased 8%,\ndriven mainly by an increase in professional services related to our\nongoing platform integrity efforts. G&A decreased 34%, driven primarily by\nlower legal-related costs.\n\nWe ended Q1 with over 76,800 employees, up 4% quarter-over-quarter. First\nquarter operating income was $17.6 billion, representing a 41% operating\nmargin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 9% as we recognized excess tax\nbenefits from share-based compensation due to the increase in our share\nprice versus prior periods. Net\n\n[Audio Gap]\n\nexpenditures, including principal payments on finance leases were $13.7\nbillion, driven by investments in servers, data centers and network\ninfrastructure. Free cash flow was $10.3 billion. We repurchased $13.4\nbillion of our Class A common stock and paid $1.3 billion in dividends to\nshareholders, ending the quarter with $70.2 billion in cash and marketable\nsecurities and $28.8 billion in debt.\n\nMoving now to our segment results. I'll begin with our Family of Apps\nsegment. Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow, and we\nestimate more than 3.4 billion people used at least one of our Family of\nApps on a daily basis in March. Q1 total Family of Apps revenue was $41.9\nbillion, up 16% year-over-year. Q1 Family of Apps ad revenue was $41.4\nbillion, up 16% or 20% on a constant currency basis.\n\nWithin ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor\nto year-over-year growth. On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was\nstrongest in Rest of World and North America at 19% and 18%, respectively.\nEurope and Asia Pacific grew 14% and 12%.\n\nIn Q1, the total number of ad impressions served across our services\nincreased 5%, and the average price per ad increased 10%. Impression growth\nwas mainly driven by Asia Pacific. Pricing growth benefited from increased\nadvertiser demand, in part driven by improved ad performance. This was\npartially offset by impression growth, particularly from lower monetizing\nregions and surfaces.\n\nFamily of Apps other revenue was $510 million, up 34%, driven mostly by\nbusiness messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp business platform as\nwell as Meta verified subscriptions. We continue to direct the majority of\nour investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps.\nIn Q1, Family of Apps expenses were $20.1 billion, representing 81% of our\noverall expenses. Family of Apps expenses were up 10%, mainly due to growth\nin employee compensation and infrastructure costs, which were partially\noffset by lower legal-related expenses. Family of Apps operating income was\n$21.8 billion, representing a 52% operating margin.\n\nWithin our Reality Labs segment, Q1 revenue was $412 million, down 6% year-\nover-year due to lower Meta Quest sales, which were partially offset by\nincreased sales of Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses. Reality Labs expenses were $4.6\nbillion, up 8% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher employee\ncompensation. Reality Labs operating loss was $4.2 billion.\n\nTurning now to the business outlook. There are 2 primary factors that drive\nour revenue performance: our ability to deliver engaging experiences for\nour community and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over\ntime. On the first, we're focused both on enhancing our core Family of Apps\ntoday and building the next generation of devices and experiences through\nReality Labs.\n\nI'll start with our Family of Apps. In the first quarter, we saw strong\ngrowth in video consumption across both Facebook and Instagram,\nparticularly in the U.S., where video time spent grew double digits year-\nover-year. This growth continues to be driven primarily by ongoing\nenhancements to our recommendation systems, and we see opportunities to\ndeliver further gains this year.\n\nWe're also progressing on longer-term efforts to develop innovative new\napproaches to recommendations. A big focus of this work will be on\ndeveloping increasingly efficient recommendation systems so that we can\ncontinue scaling up the complexity and compute used to train our models\nwhile avoiding diminishing returns. There are promising techniques we're\nworking on that will incorporate the innovations from LLM model\narchitectures to achieve this.\n\nAnother area that is showing early promise is integrating LLM technology\ninto our content recommendation systems. For example, we're finding that\nLLM's ability to understand a piece of content more deeply than traditional\nrecommendation systems can help better identify what is interesting to\nsomeone about a piece of content, leading to better recommendations.\n\nWe began testing using Llama in Threads recommendation systems at the end\nof last year given the app's text-based content and have already seen a 4%\nlift in time spent from the first launch. It remains early here, but a big\nfocus this year will be on exploring how we can deploy this for other\ncontent types, including photos and videos. We also expect this to be\ncomplementary to Meta AI as it can provide more relevant responses to\npeople's queries by better understanding their interests and preferences\nthrough their interactions across Facebook, Instagram and Threads.\n\nEarlier this year, we began testing the ability for Meta AI to better\npersonalize its responses by remembering certain details from people's\nprior queries and considering what that person engages with on our apps. We\nare already seeing this lead to deeper engagement with people we've rolled\nit out to, and it is now built into Meta AI across Facebook, Instagram,\nMessenger and our new stand-alone Meta AI app in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nWe're also continuing to focus on helping people connect over content. In\nQ1, we launched a new experience on Instagram in the U.S. that consists of\na feed of content your friends have left a note on or liked, and we're\nseeing good results. We also just launched Blend, which is an opt-in\nexperience in direct messages that enables you to blend your Reels\nalgorithm with your friends to spark conversations over each other's\ninterest. These features all lean into Instagram's position at the\nintersection of entertainment and social connection.\n\nWhatsApp remains, at its core, a private messaging app. But it has evolved\nto also become a place people come to get updates from accounts they are\nconnected to or follow. Today, there are tens of billions of views of\nstatus posts on WhatsApp each day, and we continue to invest in the updates\ntab as a place people can go to do more.\n\nCreators remain another big focus for us and we're investing in tools to\nhelp them produce the best original content on our platforms. Last week, we\nlaunched our stand-alone Edits app, which supports the full creative\nprocess for video creators from inspiration and creation to performance\ninsights. Edits has an ultra-high resolution, short-form video camera and\nincludes generative AI tools that enable people to remove the background of\nany video or animate still images with more features coming soon.\n\nMoving to Reality Labs. We're seeing very strong traction with Ray-Ban Meta\nAI glasses with over 4x as many monthly actives as a year ago. And the\nnumber of people using voice commands is growing even faster as people use\nit to answer questions and control their glasses. This month, we fully\nrolled out live translations on Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses to all markets for\nEnglish, French, Italian and Spanish. Now when you are speaking to someone\nin one of these languages, you'll hear what they say in your preferred\nlanguage through the glasses in real time.\n\nNow to the second driver of our revenue performance, increasing\nmonetization efficiency. The first part of this work is optimizing the\nlevel of ads within organic engagement. We continue to optimize ad supply\nacross each service to better deliver ads at the time and place they are\nmost relevant to people. We are also starting to introduce ads on\nunmonetized surfaces like Threads, which we opened up to all eligible\nadvertisers this month to reach people in over 30 different markets to\nstart, including the U.S. As we do for any newly monetized surface, we\nexpect to gradually ramp ad supply as we optimize the ad formats and ensure\nthey feel native to the app. We don't expect Threads to be a meaningful\ndriver of overall impression or revenue growth in 2025.\n\nThe second part of increasing monetization efficiency is improving\nmarketing performance. We're continuing to improve our ad systems by\ndeveloping new modeling technologies to more efficiently predict the right\nad to show. In Q1, we introduced our new Generative Ads Recommendation\nModel, or GEM, for ads ranking. This model uses a new architecture we\ndeveloped that is twice as efficient at improving ad performance for a\ngiven amount of data and compute. This efficiency gain enabled us to\nsignificantly scale up the amount of compute we use for model training with\nGEM trained on thousands of GPUs, our largest cluster for ads training to\ndate. We began testing the new model for ads recommendations on Facebook\nReels earlier this year and have seen up to a 5% increase in ad\nconversions. We're now rolling it out to additional surfaces across our\napps.\n\nOn the ads product side, we're seeing continued momentum with our\nAdvantage+ suite of AI-powered solutions. We've been encouraged by the\ninitial test of our streamlined campaign creation flow for sales, app and\nlead campaigns, which starts with Advantage+ turned on from the beginning\nfor advertisers. In April, we rolled this out to more advertisers and\nexpect to complete the global rollout later this year.\n\nWe're also seeing strong adoption of Advantage+ Creative. This week, we are\nbroadening access of video expansion to Facebook Reels for all eligible\nadvertisers, enabling them to automatically adjust the aspect ratio of\ntheir existing videos by generating new pixels in each frame to optimize\ntheir ads for full screen surfaces. We also rolled out image generation to\nall eligible advertisers. And this quarter, we plan to continue testing a\nnew virtual try-on feature that uses gen AI to place clothing on virtual\nmodels, helping customers visualize how an item may look and fit.\n\nLast, we continue to evolve our ads platform to drive results that are\noptimized for each business' objectives and the way they measure value. One\nexample of this is our incremental attribution feature, which enables\nadvertisers to optimize for driving incremental conversions or conversions\nwe believe would not have occurred without an ad being shown. We're seeing\nstrong results in testing so far with advertisers using incremental\nattribution in tests seeing an average 46% lift in incremental conversions\ncompared to their business-as-usual approach. We expect to make this\navailable to all advertisers in the coming weeks.\n\nNext, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. Our\nprimary focus remains investing capital back into the business with\ninfrastructure and talent being our top priorities. Starting with\nheadcount, our hiring continues to be targeted at technical roles within\nour company priorities. In the first quarter, the significant majority of\nthe roughly 2,800 employees we added were to support our priorities of\nmonetization, infrastructure, generative AI, regulation and compliance and\nReality Labs.\n\nOn infrastructure, we have 2 primary focuses to meet the growing compute\nneeds of our services and AI initiatives. The first way is by significantly\nscaling up our infrastructure footprint. Our CapEx growth this year is\ngoing toward both generative AI and core business needs with the majority\nof overall CapEx supporting the core. We expect the significant\ninfrastructure footprint we are building will not only help us meet the\ndemands of our business in the near term but also provide us an advantage\nin the quality and scale of AI services we can deliver. We continue to\nbuild this capacity in a way that grants us maximum flexibility in how and\nwhen we deploy it to ensure we have the agility to react to how the\ntechnology and industry develop in the coming years.\n\nThe second way we're meeting our compute needs is by increasing the\nefficiency of our workloads. In fact, many of the innovations coming out of\nour ranking work are focused on increasing the efficiency of our systems.\nThis emphasis on efficiency is helping us deliver consistently strong\nreturns from our core AI initiatives. For example, we shared on the Q3 2024\ncall that improvements to our AI-driven feed and video recommendations\ndrove a roughly 8% lift in time spent on Facebook and a 6% lift on\nInstagram over the first 9 months of last year. Since then, we've been able\nto deliver similar gains in just 6 months' time with improvements to our AI\nrecommendations delivering 7% and 6% time spent gains on Facebook and\nInstagram, respectively.\n\nBefore moving to our financial guidance, I want to acknowledge the dynamic\nmacro environment and note that our range reflects the potential for a\nwider set of outcomes. We continue to feel good about the fundamental\ndrivers of revenue growth and believe the past work we've done to\nstreamline our operations and cost profile puts us in a strong position to\nnavigate a variety of outcomes.\n\nMoving to our financial outlook. We expect second quarter 2025 total\nrevenue to be in the range of $42.5 billion to $45.5 billion. Our guidance\nassumes foreign currency is an approximately 1% tailwind to year-over-year\ntotal revenue growth based on current exchange rates.\n\nTurning now to the expense outlook. We expect full year 2025 total expenses\nto be in the range of $113 million to $118 billion, lowered from our prior\noutlook of $114 billion to $119 billion.\n\nTurning now to the CapEx outlook. We anticipate our full year 2025 capital\nexpenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, will be in\nthe range of $64 billion to $72 billion, increased from our prior outlook\nof $60 billion to $65 billion. This updated outlook reflects additional\ndata center investments to support our AI efforts as well as an increase in\nthe expected cost of infrastructure hardware. The majority of our CapEx in\n2025 will continue to be directed to our core business.\n\nOn to tax. Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full year\n2025 tax rate to be in the range of 12% to 15%. In addition, we continue to\nmonitor an active regular landscape, including legal and regulatory\nheadwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our\nbusiness and our financial results.\n\nThe European Commission recently announced its decision that our\nsubscription for no ads model is not compliant with the DMA. Based on\nfeedback from the European Commission in connection with the DMA, we expect\nwe will need to make some modifications to our model, which could result in\na materially worse user experience for European users and a significant\nimpact to our European business and revenue as early as the third quarter\nof 2025. We will appeal the commission's DMA decision, but any\nmodifications to our model may be imposed before or during the appeal\nprocess.\n\nIn closing, this was another solid quarter for our business. We believe the\ninvestments we're making across our company priorities will position us\nwell in the coming years to continue delivering engaging services for our\ncommunity, compelling results for advertisers and strong business\nperformance.\nWith that, Krista, let's open up the call for questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of\nBrian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\n\nBrian Thomas Nowak\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\n\nI have 2. The first one is on Llama. Mark, can you -- the LLM landscape\ncontinues to sort of evolve and be somewhat competitive. Can you sort of\ntalk us through some of the key areas of advancement you are most focused\non and excited about as we sort of think about Behemoth and next versions\nof Llama to come? And then the second one on Meta AI, almost 1 billion\nusers globally. Any help on sort of how you're seeing U.S. traction there\nand the types of recurring user behaviors that you're seeing in the early\nMeta AI use cases?\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nSure. I can talk about the LLMs. On the Meta AI usage, I'm not sure if we\nhave more stats to share on that now. Yes, it's -- I'll defer to Susan if\nthere's anything that we're ready on that. On the LLM, yes, there's a lot\nof progress being made in a lot of different dimensions. And the reason why\nwe want to build this out is -- one is that we think it's important that\nfor kind of how critical this is for our business that we sort of have\ncontrol of our own destiny and are not depending on another company for\nsomething so critical. But two, we want to make sure that we can shape the\ndevelopment to be optimized for our infrastructure and the use cases that\nwe want.\n\nSo to that end, Llama 4, the shape of the model with 17 billion parameters\nper expert was designed specifically for the infrastructure that we have in\norder to provide the low latency experience to be voice optimized. One of\nthe key things, if you're having a voice conversation with AI, is it needs\nto be low latency. So that way, when you're having a conversation with it,\nthere's isn't a large gap between when you stop speaking and it starts. So\neverything from the shape of the model to the research that we're doing to\ntechniques that go into it are kind of fit into that.\n\nSimilarly, another thing that we focused on was context window length. And\nin some of our models, we have really -- we're industry-leading on context\nwindow length. And part of the reason why we think that that's important is\nbecause we're very focused on providing a personalized experience. And\nthere are different ways that you can put personalization context into an\nLLM, but one of the ways to do it is to include some of that context in the\ncontext window. And having a long context window that can incorporate a lot\nof the background that the person has shared across our apps is one way to\ndo that.\n\nSo that's like -- it kind of is giving you a flavor of the products that\nwe're trying to build and then some specific technical architecture\ndecisions and research prioritization that we basically have made in order\nto deliver the specific experience that we're going for. I could go on and\nadd a lot more.\n\nThe reason I think it's also very important to deliver big models like\nBehemoth, not because we're going to end up serving them in production, but\nbecause of the technique of distilling from larger models, right? The Llama\n4 models that we've published so far and the ones that we're using\ninternally and some of the ones that we'll build in the future are\nbasically distilled from the Behemoth model in order to get the 90%, 95% of\nthe intelligence of the large model in a form factor that is much lower\nlatency and much more efficient.\n\nSo these things are all very important. Obviously, we wouldn't be able to\ndo that kind of distillation from other closed models. So that kind of\ngives you a flavor for how we're thinking about the development of this.\nAnd then, of course, the models and the infrastructure that we're building\nout power all of the opportunities that I mentioned before.\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nBrian, I'm happy to answer your second question about Meta AI. The top use\ncase right now for Meta AI from a query perspective is really around\ninformation gathering as people are using it to search for and understand\nand analyze information followed by social interactions from -- ranging\nfrom casual chatting to more in-depth discussion or debate. We also see\npeople use it for writing assistance, interacting with visual content,\nseeking help. And we see Meta -- people engage with Meta AI from several\ndifferent entry points.\n\nWhatsApp continues to see the strongest Meta AI usage across our Family of\nApps. Most of that WhatsApp engagement is in one-on-one Threads, followed\nby Facebook, which is the second largest driver of Meta AI engagement,\nwhere we're seeing strong engagement from our feed deep dives integration\nthat lets people ask Meta AI questions about the content that's recommended\nto them. And we're obviously excited about the launch of the Meta AI stand-\nalone app.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.\n\nEric James Sheridan\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\n\nMaybe following up on Brian's question and coming at it from a different\nangle. I appreciate the color on the use cases you're seeing today for Meta\nAI. How would you suspect those use cases evolve with a stand-alone app?\nCan you bring us into a little bit the decision process to do a stand-alone\napp, what that might change in terms of utility, frequency or scale\nrelative to what you see inside Family of Apps today? And how do you think\nabout positioning Meta AI as a stand-alone app, I guess, the competitive\nlandscape today of other stand-alone sort of consumer AI apps?\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nYes, I can talk about that. We're going to focus on both integrating it\ninto our Family of Apps in more ways and building a stand-alone experience.\nI think some people want faster access to it or a more built-out feature\nset than you can build into an app like WhatsApp. So the stand-alone app\nwill be valuable for that. I also think that the stand-alone app is going\nto be particularly important in the United States because WhatsApp, as\nSusan said, is the largest surface that people use Meta AI and which makes\nsense. If you want to text an AI, having that be closely integrated and a\ngood experience in the messaging app that you use makes a lot of sense.\n\nBut we're -- while we have more than 100 million people use WhatsApp in the\nUnited States, we're clearly not the primary messaging app in the United\nStates at this point. iMessage is. We hope to become the leader over time.\nBut we're in a different position there than we are in most of the rest of\nthe world on WhatsApp. So I think that the Meta AI app as a stand-alone is\ngoing to be particularly important in the United States to establishing\nleadership in -- as the main personal AI that people use. But we're going\nto keep on advancing the experiences across the board in all of these\ndifferent areas.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.\n\nJustin Post\nBofA Securities, Research Division\n\nA couple of questions. Just on the guide in the second quarter, there are\nreports of potential supply issues in e-commerce. Have you thought about\nthat in the guide? And maybe how are you thinking about it for the back\nhalf? And then on a bigger picture question. Your CapEx spend is now close\nto some hyperscalers with very big client bases. Just help us conceptualize\nthe kind of ecosystem you're building with your CapEx. I know you gave a\nlot of help on the intro, but maybe the ROI works without direct enterprise\nspend to drive revenues. How are you thinking about that?\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Justin. On the Q2 guide, there's uncertainty, obviously, in how the\nmacro environment will evolve over time and how that could impact different\nsegments of our business. Our Q2 revenue outlook aims to factor that in.\nAnd partly -- that's partly why the $3 billion range reflects the potential\nfor a wider range of outcomes. Specifically, we have seen some reduced\nspend in the U.S. from Asia-based e-commerce exporters, which we believe is\nin anticipation of the de minimis exemption going away on May 2. A portion\nof that spend has been redirected to other markets, but overall spend for\nthose advertisers is below the levels prior to April. But our Q2 outlook\nreflects the trends we're seeing so far in April, which have generally been\nhealthy. So it's very early. Hard to know how things will play out over the\nquarter and certainly harder to know that for the rest of the year.\n\nYour second question is about why we're investing more in CapEx. And we\nreally believe that our ability to build world-class infrastructure gives\nus a meaningful advantage in both developing the leading AI technology and\nservices over the coming years. And there are a lot of opportunities also\nfor us to improve our core business by putting more compute against our ads\nand recommendation work. So even with the capacity that we're bringing\nonline in 2025, we are having a hard time meeting the demand that teams\nhave for compute resources across the company. So we are going to\ncontinually invest meaningfully here across our infrastructure footprint,\nbut we are also really looking to build this capacity in a way that gives\nus the maximum flexibility in how and when we deploy it over the coming\nyears so we can respond to how the market and technology develop.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\n\nDouglas Till Anmuth\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nI just wanted to follow up on CapEx and infrastructure spending. Just on\nthe higher range for CapEx, can you just help us understand how much of\nthat is tied to the additional data center investments versus the increased\nhardware costs? And really what's driving those higher hardware costs? And\nthen separately, there have been some articles suggesting that you've been\nlooking to partner to share some of the costs of the AI infrastructure\nbuild-out. Can you just help us understand your thought process there and\nsome of the pros and cons of going alone versus partnering?\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Doug. So our increased CapEx outlook reflects both of those\nupdates, the increased data center spend this year as we have made some\nadjustments to flex our build strategy that will enable us to really stand\nup capacity more quickly, both in '25 and '26. We haven't broken down sort\nof the exact drivers. The higher costs we expect to incur for\ninfrastructure hardware this year really comes from suppliers who source\nfrom countries around the world. And there's just a lot of uncertainty\naround this, given the ongoing trade discussions. And so that is both\nreflected in the wider range that we are giving. And we're also working on\nour end on mitigations by optimizing our supply chain, and our outlook is\nreally trying to reflect our best understanding of the potential impact\nthis year across all of that uncertainty.\n\nOn the second part of your question, we are -- we're pleased to have\npartners investing alongside us and bringing Llama to market like AWS and\nAzure, who are helping us host Llama. We're always looking for\nopportunities to continue deepening or expanding those partnerships. But we\nare funding the infrastructure that is being used to train Llama, and we\ndon't have any expectation that, that will change at this point.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Shmulik with Bernstein.\n\nMark Elliott Shmulik\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\n\nMark, in your conversation last night with Satya, I think you both\ndiscussed a bit around kind of the portion of code being written internally\nby AI. Kind of back to some of your previous comments around this being the\nyear where we might see AI kind of the place of a mid-level engineer. With\nthe world evolving so quickly, can you share some places where you've seen\nstrong traction there? And are we progressing kind of faster, slower or as\nyou expected towards this milestone? And then, Susan, with the expense\nguidance coming down just a touch, how should we think about just the\noverall cadence of expected spending really as it relates to kind of core\nbusiness performance and the realities of the day-to-day world we're living\nin?\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nI can talk about the coding agent work. I don't think that there's been any\nreal change in our prediction for the timing of this. So I'd say it's\nbasically still on track for something around a mid-level engineer kind of\nstarting to become possible sometime this year, scaling into next year. So\nI'd expect that by the middle to end of next year, AI coding agents are\ngoing to be doing a substantial part of AI research and development. So\nwe're focused on that.\n\nInternally, we're also very focused on building AI agents or systems that\ncan help run different experiments to increase recommendations across our\nother AI products like the ones that do recommendations across our feeds\nand things like that. So I think that, if it works, should just accelerate\nour progress in those areas. That's the basic bet that we're making.\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nYour second question about our lowered expense outlook. Really, we are 4\nmonths into the year. The lowered outlook reflects more refined forecasts,\nincluding updated expectations for both employee compensation as well as\nsome other non-headcount-related operating expenses this year. And that's\npartially offset by higher expected infrastructure costs related to our\nincreased CapEx outlook as well as higher expected Reality Labs cost of\ngoods sold. And we've maintained our $5 billion range just given the more\ndynamic operating environment that we're in.\n\nAnd what I would say is our investment posture today reflects the\nsignificant opportunities that we see across either the company and\npriorities that we're investing in this year. We will obviously continue\nevaluating depending on how macro conditions more broadly evolve. But we\nreally feel like these are big strategic priorities for us and are critical\nfor us to continue investing in. And in fact, I think one of the aims of\nour efficiency work over the last 2 years was to put us in a stronger\nfinancial position so that we can continue investing in key priorities\nthrough tougher financial cycles.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.\n\nRoss Adam Sandler\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\n\nGreat. Mark, yesterday in one of your many kind of podcast or keynote\npresentations, you had mentioned that like a bunch of projects that your\nteams want to or aspire to do or kind of bottlenecked by the AI capacity,\nwhich Susan just talked about earlier, and that even some of the testing\nthat the ad ranking team wants to run is just getting kind of delayed. So I\nguess looking out either this year or next year or whatever, when do you\nkind of see some of this constraint being eased back? And more broadly,\nwe're kind of 3 years past the IDFA impact to your business. So where do\nyou think we are in terms of just the overall improvements to the ad\nranking system, the ROI that you guys are able to deliver? And like what\ninning are we in on that in your opinion?\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nI can take a shot at both of those. And Mark, you can obviously chime in.\nOn the first question, the capacity landscape we are in is pretty dynamic,\nboth in terms of the many moving parts in terms of us bringing capacity\nonline but also in terms of the demand from different product groups in our\ncompany, whether they are in the gen AI teams or whether they're doing more\nof the core AI work around ranking and recommendations.\n\nSo both the supply and demand are quite fluid. And so we don't have a sort\nof fixed answer in terms of when we expect that we will sort of have enough\nsupply to meet all demand. But that's something that we are working very\nhard to alleviate, and it's part of why we accelerated bringing more data\ncenter space online this year. And also, we're very focused on increasing\nthe efficiency of our workloads over the course of the year.\n\nOn your second question about ads, performance ads ranking, we have\ninvested for many years and continue to invest in driving ad performance\nimprovements. Year-over-year conversion growth remains strong. And in fact,\nwe continue to see conversions grow at a faster rate than ad impressions in\nQ1, so reflecting increased conversion rates. And ads ranking and modeling\nimprovements are a big driver of overall performance gains. We have a lot\nof innovations and model architecture in both the ads retrieval and ranking\nstages of the ads delivery process to serve more relevant ads to people.\n\nWe talked about the introduction of the new GEM ads recommendation model in\nQ1. And we have talked about some of the prior model architecture\nimprovements like Lattice and Andromeda in past quarters. For us, we really\nbelieve, first and foremost, that advertising is a relative performance\ngame. That's especially important for us because the vast majority of our\nbusiness is direct response advertising. So we feel good about how the\nprior investments are paying off and we continue to invest in a lot of\ndifferent work to constantly improve our ads ranking and recommendations\nperformance.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Kenneth Gawrelski with Wells\nFargo.\n\nKenneth James Gawrelski\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\n\nTwo for me, please. First, maybe, Mark, how should we think about the\ntiming of AI capabilities necessary to drive WhatsApp for business adoption\nin higher labor -- cost labor markets? What is Meta doing to accelerate\nthat adoption? And do you see this as mostly incremental to SME ad spend\nthat you're already capturing? And then for Susan, one, please. What does\nthe revised CapEx outlook for this year for '25 mean about future years?\nDoes it mean anything? Or you talked about this being an acceleration in\nyour revised outlook statement. Should we think about this as a new\nstarting point for -- to think about '26 and beyond? Or should we just\nstart fresh in '26 and think about the needs and capacity at that point?\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nI'm happy to take -- I'll go ahead and take both of those. And Mark, you\nshould feel free to chime in wherever you would like. So Mark talked a\nlittle bit about our general vision that every business will soon have an\nAI that is an expert in their business for their customers to talk to in\nthe same way that today they've got e-mail and websites, social media\npresences, et cetera. We are currently testing business AIs with a limited\nset of businesses in the U.S. and a few additional countries on WhatsApp,\nMessenger and on ads on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nWe've been starting with small business and focusing first on helping them\nsell their goods and services with business AIs. But ultimately, we are\nworking on tools to support businesses at every stage of the customer\nfunnel from lead generation to order management and customer service. And a\ncore area that we're addressing right now is really the ability for\nbusinesses to customize and control the agent to achieve the outcome that\nthey want.\n\nSo we've launched a new agent management experience and dashboard that\nmakes it easier for businesses to train their AI based on existing\ninformation on their website or WhatsApp profile or their Instagram and\nFacebook pages. And we're starting with the ability for businesses to\nactivate AI in their chats with customers. We are also testing business AIs\non Facebook and Instagram ads that you can ask about product and return\npolicies or assist you in making a purchase within our in-app browser.\n\nSo again, the ultimate vision is to build an experience that serves\ncustomers across all of these different services and apps. No matter where\nyou engage with the business AI, it should be one agent that recalls your\nhistory and your preferences. And we're hearing encouraging feedback,\nparticularly that adopting these AIs are saving the business that we're\ntesting with a lot of time and helping to determine which conversations\nmake sense for them to spend more time on.\n\nAnd then your second question, right, was about 2026 CapEx. Infrastructure,\nas I alluded to earlier, just is a very dynamic planning area given the\ncontinued advances in AI and also for us, the fact that we continue to find\na lot of good use cases to put capacity toward in our core AI ranking and\nrecommendations work. So I would say it's too early to discuss plans beyond\n2025.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Truist\nSecurities.\n\nYoussef Houssaini Squali\nTruist Securities, Inc., Research Division\n\nSo Mark, in a world where we now have maybe 5 to 10 chatbots, including\nMeta AI on our smartphone is doing virtually the same thing, do you think\nthis is a market much like Search where the winner takes most or is it\nlikely to be much more fragmented? But in either case, what would you say\nare the top 2 or 3 competitive advantages of Meta AI? And then, Susan, on\nthe EU decision in connection with the DMA, what kind of modifications will\nyou need to make to the apps? And can you maybe just help us gauge the\npotential financial fallout, understanding that it may obviously be too\nearly?\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nYes. On Meta AI, I mean, I think that there are going to be a number of\ndifferent agents that people use, just like people use different apps for\ndifferent things. I'm not sure that people are going to use multiple agents\nfor the same exact things, but I'd imagine that something that is more\nfocused on kind of enterprise productivity might be different from\nsomething that is somewhat more optimized for personal productivity. And\nthat might be somewhat different from something that is optimized for\nentertainment and social connectivity. So I think there will be different\nexperiences.\n\nOne of the trends that I think we're starting to see now is personalization\nacross these. Right now, if the experience is unpersonalized, then you can\nkind of just go to different apps and get reasonably similar answers to\ndifferent questions. But once an AI starts getting to know you and what you\ncare about in context and can build up memory from the conversations that\nyou've had with it over time, I think that will start to become somewhat\nmore of a differentiator. So that's one thing that we think will matter.\n\nAnd then, of course, there's all the different modalities. Being able to\nnot just answer questions about in text but being able to do voice and\nmultimodal and be able to produce images and videos and understand all\nthose things and have good conversations about that, I think, is going to\nbe important overall. So yes, I mean, I think Meta AI is well positioned,\nbut we have a lot of work to do in order to make it the leading personal\nAI.\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nAnd Youssef, on your second question, it is really too early to speak about\nwhat those changes could be because we are in the process of engaging with\nthe European Commission. I think maybe the most useful sort of metric I\ncould give you is just that our advertising revenue in the European\neconomic area in Switzerland, which would be the geographies impacted here,\nwas 16% of our worldwide total revenue in 2024. Again, we are continuing to\nengage actively with the European Commission further on this, so we hope to\nhave more clarity by next quarter's call.\n\nKenneth J. Dorell\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nKrista, we have time for one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour last question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.\n\nMark Stephen F. Mahaney\nEvercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division\n\nI'll just throw in 2. I think you called out that the China-based retailers\nas one sort of potentially soft advertising vertical. Anything else you'd\ncall out? And I would just suggest autos. Is that an area of any softness?\nAnd then on the Reality Labs and on the losses associated with Reality\nLabs, they've been very consistent, whatever, $4 billion a quarter for\nquite some time. Is there light at the end of the tunnel? Is there a reason\nto think -- is there a factor that would occur that would cause those\nlosses to come down? And when would that be? But maybe more importantly,\nwhat is going to cause those losses to come down?\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nMark, let me take your first question about other verticals. We generally\nsaw healthy growth in most verticals in Q1. We did see some weakness in\ngaming and politics. So year-over-year growth in gaming was negative in Q1\nas we lapped a period of strong spend from China-based advertisers that\nwere promoting a larger volume of game titles in Q1 of 2024. And then year-\nover-year growth in the government and politics vertical dropped sharply as\nexpected with the conclusion of U.S. elections, but that continues to just\nbe a very small vertical overall. And then your second question on Reality\nLabs -- yes.\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nYes, Reality Labs one. I mean we're basically focused on doing the work\nmore efficiently. But as the AI glasses have really taken off -- I've\ntalked about this on a number of calls. There are more investments that I\nthink makes sense to make around making sure that we can distribute this\nand grow it very quickly. I mean some of the -- if you look at some of the\nleading consumer electronics products of other categories, by the time they\nget to their third generation, they're often selling 10 million units and\nscaling from there. And I'm not sure if we're going to do exactly that, but\nI think that that's like the ballpark of the opportunity that we have. And\nthat's something that I think we're kind of focused on scaling to that and\nthen scaling beyond that for the generations after that.\n\nSo I think some of the effort that we're doing is going to -- we're going\nto get more efficient in some parts of the work that we do. But then as a\nbunch of the products start to hit and start to grow even bigger than the\nnumber that I just said is just sort of like the sort of a near-term\nmilestone, then I think we'll continue scaling in terms of distribution.\nAnd then at some point, just like the other products that we build out, we\nwill feel like we're at a sufficient scale that we're going to primarily\nfocus on making sure that we're monetizing and building an efficient\nbusiness around it. But that's kind of where we're at on it. We're\ndefinitely focused on doing the work more efficiently but also very\noptimistic about what we're seeing in the results, especially on the AI\nglasses side.\n\nKenneth J. Dorell\nDirector of Investor RelationsGreat.

  "presentation_text": "Operator\n\nGood afternoon. My name is Krista, and I will be your conference operator\ntoday. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Meta First\nQuarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call will be\nrecorded.\n\nThank you very much. Ken Dorell, Meta's Director of Investor Relations, you\nmay begin.\n\nKenneth J. Dorell\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Meta's First Quarter 2025\nEarnings Conference Call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark\nZuckerberg, CEO; and Susan Li, CFO.\n\nOur remarks today will include forward-looking statements, which are based\non assumptions as of today. Actual results may differ materially as a\nresult of various factors, including those set forth in today's earnings\npress release and in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. We\nundertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.\n\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial\nmeasures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in\ntoday's earnings press release. The earnings press release and an\naccompanying investor presentation are available on our website at\ninvestor.atmeta.com.\n\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nAll right. Thanks, Ken. Thanks, everyone, for joining today. We've had a\nstrong start to the year. Our community keeps growing with more than 3.4\nbillion people now using at least one of our apps each day. Our business is\nalso performing very well, and I think we're well positioned to navigate\nthe macroeconomic uncertainty.\n\nThe major theme right now, of course, is how AI is transforming everything\nwe do. And as we continue to increase our investments and focus more of our\nresources on AI, I thought it would be useful today to lay out the 5 major\nopportunities that we are focused on. Those are improved advertising, more\nengaging experiences, business messaging, Meta AI and AI devices. And these\nare each long-term investments that are downstream from us building general\nintelligence and leading AI models and infrastructure. Even with our\nsignificant investments, we don't need to succeed in all of these areas to\nhave a good ROI. But if we do, then I think that we will be wildly happy\nwith the investments that we are making.\n\nThe first opportunity is improved advertising. Our goal is to make it so\nthat any business can basically tell us what objective they're trying to\nachieve like selling something or getting a new customer and how much\nthey're willing to pay for each result and then we just do the rest.\nBusinesses used to have to generate their own ad creative and define what\naudiences they wanted to reach, but AI has already made us better at\ntargeting and finding the audiences that will be interested in their\nproducts than many businesses are themselves, and that keeps improving. And\nnow AI is generating better creative options for many businesses as well.\n\nI think that this is really redefining what advertising is into an AI agent\nthat delivers measurable business results at scale. And if we deliver on\nthis vision, then over the coming years, I think that the increased\nproductivity from AI will make advertising a meaningfully larger share of\nglobal GDP than it is today. In just the last quarter, we are testing a new\nads recommendation model for Reels, which has already increased conversion\nrates by 5%. And we're seeing 30% more advertisers are using AI creative\ntools in the last quarter as well.\n\nThe second opportunity is more engaging experiences. This will come in 2\nforms: better recommendations for existing content types and better new\ntypes of content. In the last 6 months, improvements to our recommendation\nsystems have led to a 7% increase in time spent on Facebook, 6% increase on\nInstagram and 35% on Threads. Threads now also has more than 350 million\nmonthly actives and continues to be on track to become our next major\nsocial app.\n\nIn addition to better recommendations for existing content types, AI is\nalso enabling the creation of better content as well. Some of this will be\nhelping people produce better content to share themselves. Some of this\nwill be AI generating content directly for people that is personalized for\nthem. Some of this will be in existing formats like photos and videos, and\nsome of it will be increasingly interactive.\n\nI've often talked about this long-term trend of content becoming richer\nover time. Our feeds started mostly with text and then became mostly photos\nwhen we all got mobile phones with cameras and then became mostly video\nwhen mobile networks became fast enough to handle that well. We are now in\nthe video era, but I don't think that this is the end of the line. In the\nnear future, I think that we're going to have content in our feeds that you\ncan interact with and that it will interact back with you rather than you\njust watching it. Over the long term, as AI unlocks more productivity in\nthe economy, I also expect that people will spend more of their time on\nentertainment and culture, which will create an even larger opportunity to\ncreate more engaging experiences across all of these apps.\n\nThe third opportunity is business messaging. Right now, the vast majority\nof our business is advertising and feeds on Facebook and Instagram. But\nWhatsApp now has more than 3 billion monthly actives with more than 100\nmillion people in the U.S. and growing quickly there. Messenger is also\nused by more than 1 billion people each month, and there are now as many\nmessages sent each day on Instagram as there are on Messenger. So business\nmessaging should be the next pillar of our business.\n\nIn countries like Thailand and Vietnam, where there is a low cost of labor,\nwe see many businesses conduct commerce through our messaging apps. There's\nactually so much business through messaging that those countries are both\nin our top 10 or 11 by revenue even though they're ranked in the 30s in\nglobal GDP. This phenomenon hasn't yet spread to developed countries\nbecause the cost of labor is too high to make this a profitable model\nbefore AI, but AI should solve this.\n\nSo in the next few years, I expect that just like every business today has\nan e-mail address, social media account and website, they'll also have an\nAI business agent that can do customer support and sales. And they should\nbe able to set that up very easily given all the context that they've\nalready put into our business platforms. And we're going to have more to\nshare on upcoming calls about our progress in this area.\n\nThe fourth opportunity is Meta AI. Across our apps, there are now almost 1\nbillion monthly actives using Meta AI. Our focus for this year is deepening\nthe experience and making AI the leading personal AI with an emphasis on\npersonalization, voice conversations and entertainment. I think that we're\nall going to have an AI that we talk to throughout the day, while we're\nbrowsing content on our phones, and eventually, as we're going through our\ndays with glasses. And I think that this is going to be one of the most\nimportant and valuable services that has ever been created.\n\nIn addition to building Meta AI into our apps, we just released our first\nMeta AI stand-alone app. It is personalized. So you can talk to it about\ninterests that you've shown while browsing Reels or different content\nacross our apps. And we built a social feed into it. So you can discover\nentertaining ways that others are using Meta AI. And initial feedback on\nthe app has been good so far.\n\nOver time, I expect the business opportunity for Meta AI to follow our\nnormal product development playbook. First, we build and scale the product.\nAnd then once it is at scale, then we focus on revenue. In this case, I\nthink that there will be a large opportunity to show product\nrecommendations or ads as well as a premium service for people who want to\nunlock more compute for additional functionality or intelligence. But I\nexpect that we're going to be largely focused on scaling and deepening\nengagement for at least the next year before we'll really be ready to start\nbuilding out the business here.\n\nThe fifth opportunity is AI devices, which is increasingly how we are\nthinking about our work on the next generation of computing platforms.\nGlasses are the ideal form factor for both AI and the metaverse. They\nenable you to let an AI see what you see, hear what you hear and talk to\nyou throughout the day. And they let you blend the physical and digital\nworlds together with holograms.\n\nMore than 1 billion people worldwide wear glasses today, and it seems\nhighly likely that these will become AI glasses over the next 5 to 10\nyears. Building the devices that people use to experience our services lets\nus deliver the highest-quality AI and social experiences. And this will\nserve as an amplifier on all of the opportunities I've mentioned so far as\nwell as unlocking some new opportunities as well.\n\nRay-Ban Meta AI glasses have tripled in sales in the last year. The people\nwho have them are using them a lot. We've got some exciting new launches\nwith our partner, EssilorLuxottica, later this year as well that should\nexpand that category and add some new technological capabilities to the\nglasses. On Quest, we are also seeing deeper engagement as Quest 3S makes\nVR accessible to more people, and more people are creating experiences in\nhorizon with AI tools.\n\nNow everything that I've talked about today is built on top of our AI\nmodels and our infrastructure. We released the first Llama 4 models earlier\nthis month. They are some of the most intelligent, best multimodal, lowest\nlatency and most efficient models that anyone has built. We have more\nmodels on the way, including the massive Llama 4 Behemoth model.\n\nOverall, we are focused on building full general intelligence. All of the\nopportunities that I've discussed today are downstream of delivering\ngeneral intelligence and doing so efficiently. The pace of progress across\nthe industry and the opportunities ahead for us are staggering. I want to\nmake sure that we're working aggressively and efficiently. And I also want\nto make sure that we are building out the leading infrastructure and teams\nthat we need to achieve our goals.\n\nSo to that end, we are accelerating some of our efforts to bring capacity\nonline more quickly this year as well as some longer-term projects that\nwill give us the flexibility to add capacity in the coming years as well.\nAnd that has increased our planned investment for this year.\n\nMore broadly, this has been a good start to what I expect will continue to\nbe an intense year. We've got a lot more exciting work in the pipeline that\nI'm looking forward to sharing soon. I continue to think that this year is\ngoing to be a pivotal moment for our industry, and I am grateful for\neveryone who is working so hard at the company to deliver all of this\namazing technology and new experiences.\n\nAs always, thank you all for being on this journey with us. And now, Susan.\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our\nconsolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless\notherwise noted.\n\nQ1 total revenue was $42.3 billion, up 16% or 19% on a constant currency\nbasis. Q1 total expenses were $24.8 billion, up 9% compared to last year.\nIn terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased 14%, driven\nprimarily by higher infrastructure costs and payments to partners,\npartially offset by a benefit from the previously announced extension of\nserver useful lives. R&D increased 22%, mostly due to higher employee\ncompensation and infrastructure costs. Marketing and sales increased 8%,\ndriven mainly by an increase in professional services related to our\nongoing platform integrity efforts. G&A decreased 34%, driven primarily by\nlower legal-related costs.\n\nWe ended Q1 with over 76,800 employees, up 4% quarter-over-quarter. First\nquarter operating income was $17.6 billion, representing a 41% operating\nmargin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 9% as we recognized excess tax\nbenefits from share-based compensation due to the increase in our share\nprice versus prior periods. Net\n\n[Audio Gap]\n\nexpenditures, including principal payments on finance leases were $13.7\nbillion, driven by investments in servers, data centers and network\ninfrastructure. Free cash flow was $10.3 billion. We repurchased $13.4\nbillion of our Class A common stock and paid $1.3 billion in dividends to\nshareholders, ending the quarter with $70.2 billion in cash and marketable\nsecurities and $28.8 billion in debt.\n\nMoving now to our segment results. I'll begin with our Family of Apps\nsegment. Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow, and we\nestimate more than 3.4 billion people used at least one of our Family of\nApps on a daily basis in March. Q1 total Family of Apps revenue was $41.9\nbillion, up 16% year-over-year. Q1 Family of Apps ad revenue was $41.4\nbillion, up 16% or 20% on a constant currency basis.\n\nWithin ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor\nto year-over-year growth. On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was\nstrongest in Rest of World and North America at 19% and 18%, respectively.\nEurope and Asia Pacific grew 14% and 12%.\n\nIn Q1, the total number of ad impressions served across our services\nincreased 5%, and the average price per ad increased 10%. Impression growth\nwas mainly driven by Asia Pacific. Pricing growth benefited from increased\nadvertiser demand, in part driven by improved ad performance. This was\npartially offset by impression growth, particularly from lower monetizing\nregions and surfaces.\n\nFamily of Apps other revenue was $510 million, up 34%, driven mostly by\nbusiness messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp business platform as\nwell as Meta verified subscriptions. We continue to direct the majority of\nour investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps.\nIn Q1, Family of Apps expenses were $20.1 billion, representing 81% of our\noverall expenses. Family of Apps expenses were up 10%, mainly due to growth\nin employee compensation and infrastructure costs, which were partially\noffset by lower legal-related expenses. Family of Apps operating income was\n$21.8 billion, representing a 52% operating margin.\n\nWithin our Reality Labs segment, Q1 revenue was $412 million, down 6% year-\nover-year due to lower Meta Quest sales, which were partially offset by\nincreased sales of Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses. Reality Labs expenses were $4.6\nbillion, up 8% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher employee\ncompensation. Reality Labs operating loss was $4.2 billion.\n\nTurning now to the business outlook. There are 2 primary factors that drive\nour revenue performance: our ability to deliver engaging experiences for\nour community and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over\ntime. On the first, we're focused both on enhancing our core Family of Apps\ntoday and building the next generation of devices and experiences through\nReality Labs.\n\nI'll start with our Family of Apps. In the first quarter, we saw strong\ngrowth in video consumption across both Facebook and Instagram,\nparticularly in the U.S., where video time spent grew double digits year-\nover-year. This growth continues to be driven primarily by ongoing\nenhancements to our recommendation systems, and we see opportunities to\ndeliver further gains this year.\n\nWe're also progressing on longer-term efforts to develop innovative new\napproaches to recommendations. A big focus of this work will be on\ndeveloping increasingly efficient recommendation systems so that we can\ncontinue scaling up the complexity and compute used to train our models\nwhile avoiding diminishing returns. There are promising techniques we're\nworking on that will incorporate the innovations from LLM model\narchitectures to achieve this.\n\nAnother area that is showing early promise is integrating LLM technology\ninto our content recommendation systems. For example, we're finding that\nLLM's ability to understand a piece of content more deeply than traditional\nrecommendation systems can help better identify what is interesting to\nsomeone about a piece of content, leading to better recommendations.\n\nWe began testing using Llama in Threads recommendation systems at the end\nof last year given the app's text-based content and have already seen a 4%\nlift in time spent from the first launch. It remains early here, but a big\nfocus this year will be on exploring how we can deploy this for other\ncontent types, including photos and videos. We also expect this to be\ncomplementary to Meta AI as it can provide more relevant responses to\npeople's queries by better understanding their interests and preferences\nthrough their interactions across Facebook, Instagram and Threads.\n\nEarlier this year, we began testing the ability for Meta AI to better\npersonalize its responses by remembering certain details from people's\nprior queries and considering what that person engages with on our apps. We\nare already seeing this lead to deeper engagement with people we've rolled\nit out to, and it is now built into Meta AI across Facebook, Instagram,\nMessenger and our new stand-alone Meta AI app in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nWe're also continuing to focus on helping people connect over content. In\nQ1, we launched a new experience on Instagram in the U.S. that consists of\na feed of content your friends have left a note on or liked, and we're\nseeing good results. We also just launched Blend, which is an opt-in\nexperience in direct messages that enables you to blend your Reels\nalgorithm with your friends to spark conversations over each other's\ninterest. These features all lean into Instagram's position at the\nintersection of entertainment and social connection.\n\nWhatsApp remains, at its core, a private messaging app. But it has evolved\nto also become a place people come to get updates from accounts they are\nconnected to or follow. Today, there are tens of billions of views of\nstatus posts on WhatsApp each day, and we continue to invest in the updates\ntab as a place people can go to do more.\n\nCreators remain another big focus for us and we're investing in tools to\nhelp them produce the best original content on our platforms. Last week, we\nlaunched our stand-alone Edits app, which supports the full creative\nprocess for video creators from inspiration and creation to performance\ninsights. Edits has an ultra-high resolution, short-form video camera and\nincludes generative AI tools that enable people to remove the background of\nany video or animate still images with more features coming soon.\n\nMoving to Reality Labs. We're seeing very strong traction with Ray-Ban Meta\nAI glasses with over 4x as many monthly actives as a year ago. And the\nnumber of people using voice commands is growing even faster as people use\nit to answer questions and control their glasses. This month, we fully\nrolled out live translations on Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses to all markets for\nEnglish, French, Italian and Spanish. Now when you are speaking to someone\nin one of these languages, you'll hear what they say in your preferred\nlanguage through the glasses in real time.\n\nNow to the second driver of our revenue performance, increasing\nmonetization efficiency. The first part of this work is optimizing the\nlevel of ads within organic engagement. We continue to optimize ad supply\nacross each service to better deliver ads at the time and place they are\nmost relevant to people. We are also starting to introduce ads on\nunmonetized surfaces like Threads, which we opened up to all eligible\nadvertisers this month to reach people in over 30 different markets to\nstart, including the U.S. As we do for any newly monetized surface, we\nexpect to gradually ramp ad supply as we optimize the ad formats and ensure\nthey feel native to the app. We don't expect Threads to be a meaningful\ndriver of overall impression or revenue growth in 2025.\n\nThe second part of increasing monetization efficiency is improving\nmarketing performance. We're continuing to improve our ad systems by\ndeveloping new modeling technologies to more efficiently predict the right\nad to show. In Q1, we introduced our new Generative Ads Recommendation\nModel, or GEM, for ads ranking. This model uses a new architecture we\ndeveloped that is twice as efficient at improving ad performance for a\ngiven amount of data and compute. This efficiency gain enabled us to\nsignificantly scale up the amount of compute we use for model training with\nGEM trained on thousands of GPUs, our largest cluster for ads training to\ndate. We began testing the new model for ads recommendations on Facebook\nReels earlier this year and have seen up to a 5% increase in ad\nconversions. We're now rolling it out to additional surfaces across our\napps.\n\nOn the ads product side, we're seeing continued momentum with our\nAdvantage+ suite of AI-powered solutions. We've been encouraged by the\ninitial test of our streamlined campaign creation flow for sales, app and\nlead campaigns, which starts with Advantage+ turned on from the beginning\nfor advertisers. In April, we rolled this out to more advertisers and\nexpect to complete the global rollout later this year.\n\nWe're also seeing strong adoption of Advantage+ Creative. This week, we are\nbroadening access of video expansion to Facebook Reels for all eligible\nadvertisers, enabling them to automatically adjust the aspect ratio of\ntheir existing videos by generating new pixels in each frame to optimize\ntheir ads for full screen surfaces. We also rolled out image generation to\nall eligible advertisers. And this quarter, we plan to continue testing a\nnew virtual try-on feature that uses gen AI to place clothing on virtual\nmodels, helping customers visualize how an item may look and fit.\n\nLast, we continue to evolve our ads platform to drive results that are\noptimized for each business' objectives and the way they measure value. One\nexample of this is our incremental attribution feature, which enables\nadvertisers to optimize for driving incremental conversions or conversions\nwe believe would not have occurred without an ad being shown. We're seeing\nstrong results in testing so far with advertisers using incremental\nattribution in tests seeing an average 46% lift in incremental conversions\ncompared to their business-as-usual approach. We expect to make this\navailable to all advertisers in the coming weeks.\n\nNext, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. Our\nprimary focus remains investing capital back into the business with\ninfrastructure and talent being our top priorities. Starting with\nheadcount, our hiring continues to be targeted at technical roles within\nour company priorities. In the first quarter, the significant majority of\nthe roughly 2,800 employees we added were to support our priorities of\nmonetization, infrastructure, generative AI, regulation and compliance and\nReality Labs.\n\nOn infrastructure, we have 2 primary focuses to meet the growing compute\nneeds of our services and AI initiatives. The first way is by significantly\nscaling up our infrastructure footprint. Our CapEx growth this year is\ngoing toward both generative AI and core business needs with the majority\nof overall CapEx supporting the core. We expect the significant\ninfrastructure footprint we are building will not only help us meet the\ndemands of our business in the near term but also provide us an advantage\nin the quality and scale of AI services we can deliver. We continue to\nbuild this capacity in a way that grants us maximum flexibility in how and\nwhen we deploy it to ensure we have the agility to react to how the\ntechnology and industry develop in the coming years.\n\nThe second way we're meeting our compute needs is by increasing the\nefficiency of our workloads. In fact, many of the innovations coming out of\nour ranking work are focused on increasing the efficiency of our systems.\nThis emphasis on efficiency is helping us deliver consistently strong\nreturns from our core AI initiatives. For example, we shared on the Q3 2024\ncall that improvements to our AI-driven feed and video recommendations\ndrove a roughly 8% lift in time spent on Facebook and a 6% lift on\nInstagram over the first 9 months of last year. Since then, we've been able\nto deliver similar gains in just 6 months' time with improvements to our AI\nrecommendations delivering 7% and 6% time spent gains on Facebook and\nInstagram, respectively.\n\nBefore moving to our financial guidance, I want to acknowledge the dynamic\nmacro environment and note that our range reflects the potential for a\nwider set of outcomes. We continue to feel good about the fundamental\ndrivers of revenue growth and believe the past work we've done to\nstreamline our operations and cost profile puts us in a strong position to\nnavigate a variety of outcomes.\n\nMoving to our financial outlook. We expect second quarter 2025 total\nrevenue to be in the range of $42.5 billion to $45.5 billion. Our guidance\nassumes foreign currency is an approximately 1% tailwind to year-over-year\ntotal revenue growth based on current exchange rates.\n\nTurning now to the expense outlook. We expect full year 2025 total expenses\nto be in the range of $113 million to $118 billion, lowered from our prior\noutlook of $114 billion to $119 billion.\n\nTurning now to the CapEx outlook. We anticipate our full year 2025 capital\nexpenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, will be in\nthe range of $64 billion to $72 billion, increased from our prior outlook\nof $60 billion to $65 billion. This updated outlook reflects additional\ndata center investments to support our AI efforts as well as an increase in\nthe expected cost of infrastructure hardware. The majority of our CapEx in\n2025 will continue to be directed to our core business.\n\nOn to tax. Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full year\n2025 tax rate to be in the range of 12% to 15%. In addition, we continue to\nmonitor an active regular landscape, including legal and regulatory\nheadwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our\nbusiness and our financial results.\n\nThe European Commission recently announced its decision that our\nsubscription for no ads model is not compliant with the DMA. Based on\nfeedback from the European Commission in connection with the DMA, we expect\nwe will need to make some modifications to our model, which could result in\na materially worse user experience for European users and a significant\nimpact to our European business and revenue as early as the third quarter\nof 2025. We will appeal the commission's DMA decision, but any\nmodifications to our model may be imposed before or during the appeal\nprocess.\n\nIn closing, this was another solid quarter for our business. We believe the\ninvestments we're making across our company priorities will position us\nwell in the coming years to continue delivering engaging services for our\ncommunity, compelling results for advertisers and strong business\nperformance.\nWith that, Krista, let's open up the call for questions.",
  "qa_text": "Operator\n\n[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of\nBrian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\n\nBrian Thomas Nowak\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\n\nI have 2. The first one is on Llama. Mark, can you -- the LLM landscape\ncontinues to sort of evolve and be somewhat competitive. Can you sort of\ntalk us through some of the key areas of advancement you are most focused\non and excited about as we sort of think about Behemoth and next versions\nof Llama to come? And then the second one on Meta AI, almost 1 billion\nusers globally. Any help on sort of how you're seeing U.S. traction there\nand the types of recurring user behaviors that you're seeing in the early\nMeta AI use cases?\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nSure. I can talk about the LLMs. On the Meta AI usage, I'm not sure if we\nhave more stats to share on that now. Yes, it's -- I'll defer to Susan if\nthere's anything that we're ready on that. On the LLM, yes, there's a lot\nof progress being made in a lot of different dimensions. And the reason why\nwe want to build this out is -- one is that we think it's important that\nfor kind of how critical this is for our business that we sort of have\ncontrol of our own destiny and are not depending on another company for\nsomething so critical. But two, we want to make sure that we can shape the\ndevelopment to be optimized for our infrastructure and the use cases that\nwe want.\n\nSo to that end, Llama 4, the shape of the model with 17 billion parameters\nper expert was designed specifically for the infrastructure that we have in\norder to provide the low latency experience to be voice optimized. One of\nthe key things, if you're having a voice conversation with AI, is it needs\nto be low latency. So that way, when you're having a conversation with it,\nthere's isn't a large gap between when you stop speaking and it starts. So\neverything from the shape of the model to the research that we're doing to\ntechniques that go into it are kind of fit into that.\n\nSimilarly, another thing that we focused on was context window length. And\nin some of our models, we have really -- we're industry-leading on context\nwindow length. And part of the reason why we think that that's important is\nbecause we're very focused on providing a personalized experience. And\nthere are different ways that you can put personalization context into an\nLLM, but one of the ways to do it is to include some of that context in the\ncontext window. And having a long context window that can incorporate a lot\nof the background that the person has shared across our apps is one way to\ndo that.\n\nSo that's like -- it kind of is giving you a flavor of the products that\nwe're trying to build and then some specific technical architecture\ndecisions and research prioritization that we basically have made in order\nto deliver the specific experience that we're going for. I could go on and\nadd a lot more.\n\nThe reason I think it's also very important to deliver big models like\nBehemoth, not because we're going to end up serving them in production, but\nbecause of the technique of distilling from larger models, right? The Llama\n4 models that we've published so far and the ones that we're using\ninternally and some of the ones that we'll build in the future are\nbasically distilled from the Behemoth model in order to get the 90%, 95% of\nthe intelligence of the large model in a form factor that is much lower\nlatency and much more efficient.\n\nSo these things are all very important. Obviously, we wouldn't be able to\ndo that kind of distillation from other closed models. So that kind of\ngives you a flavor for how we're thinking about the development of this.\nAnd then, of course, the models and the infrastructure that we're building\nout power all of the opportunities that I mentioned before.\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nBrian, I'm happy to answer your second question about Meta AI. The top use\ncase right now for Meta AI from a query perspective is really around\ninformation gathering as people are using it to search for and understand\nand analyze information followed by social interactions from -- ranging\nfrom casual chatting to more in-depth discussion or debate. We also see\npeople use it for writing assistance, interacting with visual content,\nseeking help. And we see Meta -- people engage with Meta AI from several\ndifferent entry points.\n\nWhatsApp continues to see the strongest Meta AI usage across our Family of\nApps. Most of that WhatsApp engagement is in one-on-one Threads, followed\nby Facebook, which is the second largest driver of Meta AI engagement,\nwhere we're seeing strong engagement from our feed deep dives integration\nthat lets people ask Meta AI questions about the content that's recommended\nto them. And we're obviously excited about the launch of the Meta AI stand-\nalone app.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.\n\nEric James Sheridan\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\n\nMaybe following up on Brian's question and coming at it from a different\nangle. I appreciate the color on the use cases you're seeing today for Meta\nAI. How would you suspect those use cases evolve with a stand-alone app?\nCan you bring us into a little bit the decision process to do a stand-alone\napp, what that might change in terms of utility, frequency or scale\nrelative to what you see inside Family of Apps today? And how do you think\nabout positioning Meta AI as a stand-alone app, I guess, the competitive\nlandscape today of other stand-alone sort of consumer AI apps?\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nYes, I can talk about that. We're going to focus on both integrating it\ninto our Family of Apps in more ways and building a stand-alone experience.\nI think some people want faster access to it or a more built-out feature\nset than you can build into an app like WhatsApp. So the stand-alone app\nwill be valuable for that. I also think that the stand-alone app is going\nto be particularly important in the United States because WhatsApp, as\nSusan said, is the largest surface that people use Meta AI and which makes\nsense. If you want to text an AI, having that be closely integrated and a\ngood experience in the messaging app that you use makes a lot of sense.\n\nBut we're -- while we have more than 100 million people use WhatsApp in the\nUnited States, we're clearly not the primary messaging app in the United\nStates at this point. iMessage is. We hope to become the leader over time.\nBut we're in a different position there than we are in most of the rest of\nthe world on WhatsApp. So I think that the Meta AI app as a stand-alone is\ngoing to be particularly important in the United States to establishing\nleadership in -- as the main personal AI that people use. But we're going\nto keep on advancing the experiences across the board in all of these\ndifferent areas.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.\n\nJustin Post\nBofA Securities, Research Division\n\nA couple of questions. Just on the guide in the second quarter, there are\nreports of potential supply issues in e-commerce. Have you thought about\nthat in the guide? And maybe how are you thinking about it for the back\nhalf? And then on a bigger picture question. Your CapEx spend is now close\nto some hyperscalers with very big client bases. Just help us conceptualize\nthe kind of ecosystem you're building with your CapEx. I know you gave a\nlot of help on the intro, but maybe the ROI works without direct enterprise\nspend to drive revenues. How are you thinking about that?\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Justin. On the Q2 guide, there's uncertainty, obviously, in how the\nmacro environment will evolve over time and how that could impact different\nsegments of our business. Our Q2 revenue outlook aims to factor that in.\nAnd partly -- that's partly why the $3 billion range reflects the potential\nfor a wider range of outcomes. Specifically, we have seen some reduced\nspend in the U.S. from Asia-based e-commerce exporters, which we believe is\nin anticipation of the de minimis exemption going away on May 2. A portion\nof that spend has been redirected to other markets, but overall spend for\nthose advertisers is below the levels prior to April. But our Q2 outlook\nreflects the trends we're seeing so far in April, which have generally been\nhealthy. So it's very early. Hard to know how things will play out over the\nquarter and certainly harder to know that for the rest of the year.\n\nYour second question is about why we're investing more in CapEx. And we\nreally believe that our ability to build world-class infrastructure gives\nus a meaningful advantage in both developing the leading AI technology and\nservices over the coming years. And there are a lot of opportunities also\nfor us to improve our core business by putting more compute against our ads\nand recommendation work. So even with the capacity that we're bringing\nonline in 2025, we are having a hard time meeting the demand that teams\nhave for compute resources across the company. So we are going to\ncontinually invest meaningfully here across our infrastructure footprint,\nbut we are also really looking to build this capacity in a way that gives\nus the maximum flexibility in how and when we deploy it over the coming\nyears so we can respond to how the market and technology develop.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\n\nDouglas Till Anmuth\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nI just wanted to follow up on CapEx and infrastructure spending. Just on\nthe higher range for CapEx, can you just help us understand how much of\nthat is tied to the additional data center investments versus the increased\nhardware costs? And really what's driving those higher hardware costs? And\nthen separately, there have been some articles suggesting that you've been\nlooking to partner to share some of the costs of the AI infrastructure\nbuild-out. Can you just help us understand your thought process there and\nsome of the pros and cons of going alone versus partnering?\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Doug. So our increased CapEx outlook reflects both of those\nupdates, the increased data center spend this year as we have made some\nadjustments to flex our build strategy that will enable us to really stand\nup capacity more quickly, both in '25 and '26. We haven't broken down sort\nof the exact drivers. The higher costs we expect to incur for\ninfrastructure hardware this year really comes from suppliers who source\nfrom countries around the world. And there's just a lot of uncertainty\naround this, given the ongoing trade discussions. And so that is both\nreflected in the wider range that we are giving. And we're also working on\nour end on mitigations by optimizing our supply chain, and our outlook is\nreally trying to reflect our best understanding of the potential impact\nthis year across all of that uncertainty.\n\nOn the second part of your question, we are -- we're pleased to have\npartners investing alongside us and bringing Llama to market like AWS and\nAzure, who are helping us host Llama. We're always looking for\nopportunities to continue deepening or expanding those partnerships. But we\nare funding the infrastructure that is being used to train Llama, and we\ndon't have any expectation that, that will change at this point.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Shmulik with Bernstein.\n\nMark Elliott Shmulik\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\n\nMark, in your conversation last night with Satya, I think you both\ndiscussed a bit around kind of the portion of code being written internally\nby AI. Kind of back to some of your previous comments around this being the\nyear where we might see AI kind of the place of a mid-level engineer. With\nthe world evolving so quickly, can you share some places where you've seen\nstrong traction there? And are we progressing kind of faster, slower or as\nyou expected towards this milestone? And then, Susan, with the expense\nguidance coming down just a touch, how should we think about just the\noverall cadence of expected spending really as it relates to kind of core\nbusiness performance and the realities of the day-to-day world we're living\nin?\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nI can talk about the coding agent work. I don't think that there's been any\nreal change in our prediction for the timing of this. So I'd say it's\nbasically still on track for something around a mid-level engineer kind of\nstarting to become possible sometime this year, scaling into next year. So\nI'd expect that by the middle to end of next year, AI coding agents are\ngoing to be doing a substantial part of AI research and development. So\nwe're focused on that.\n\nInternally, we're also very focused on building AI agents or systems that\ncan help run different experiments to increase recommendations across our\nother AI products like the ones that do recommendations across our feeds\nand things like that. So I think that, if it works, should just accelerate\nour progress in those areas. That's the basic bet that we're making.\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nYour second question about our lowered expense outlook. Really, we are 4\nmonths into the year. The lowered outlook reflects more refined forecasts,\nincluding updated expectations for both employee compensation as well as\nsome other non-headcount-related operating expenses this year. And that's\npartially offset by higher expected infrastructure costs related to our\nincreased CapEx outlook as well as higher expected Reality Labs cost of\ngoods sold. And we've maintained our $5 billion range just given the more\ndynamic operating environment that we're in.\n\nAnd what I would say is our investment posture today reflects the\nsignificant opportunities that we see across either the company and\npriorities that we're investing in this year. We will obviously continue\nevaluating depending on how macro conditions more broadly evolve. But we\nreally feel like these are big strategic priorities for us and are critical\nfor us to continue investing in. And in fact, I think one of the aims of\nour efficiency work over the last 2 years was to put us in a stronger\nfinancial position so that we can continue investing in key priorities\nthrough tougher financial cycles.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.\n\nRoss Adam Sandler\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\n\nGreat. Mark, yesterday in one of your many kind of podcast or keynote\npresentations, you had mentioned that like a bunch of projects that your\nteams want to or aspire to do or kind of bottlenecked by the AI capacity,\nwhich Susan just talked about earlier, and that even some of the testing\nthat the ad ranking team wants to run is just getting kind of delayed. So I\nguess looking out either this year or next year or whatever, when do you\nkind of see some of this constraint being eased back? And more broadly,\nwe're kind of 3 years past the IDFA impact to your business. So where do\nyou think we are in terms of just the overall improvements to the ad\nranking system, the ROI that you guys are able to deliver? And like what\ninning are we in on that in your opinion?\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nI can take a shot at both of those. And Mark, you can obviously chime in.\nOn the first question, the capacity landscape we are in is pretty dynamic,\nboth in terms of the many moving parts in terms of us bringing capacity\nonline but also in terms of the demand from different product groups in our\ncompany, whether they are in the gen AI teams or whether they're doing more\nof the core AI work around ranking and recommendations.\n\nSo both the supply and demand are quite fluid. And so we don't have a sort\nof fixed answer in terms of when we expect that we will sort of have enough\nsupply to meet all demand. But that's something that we are working very\nhard to alleviate, and it's part of why we accelerated bringing more data\ncenter space online this year. And also, we're very focused on increasing\nthe efficiency of our workloads over the course of the year.\n\nOn your second question about ads, performance ads ranking, we have\ninvested for many years and continue to invest in driving ad performance\nimprovements. Year-over-year conversion growth remains strong. And in fact,\nwe continue to see conversions grow at a faster rate than ad impressions in\nQ1, so reflecting increased conversion rates. And ads ranking and modeling\nimprovements are a big driver of overall performance gains. We have a lot\nof innovations and model architecture in both the ads retrieval and ranking\nstages of the ads delivery process to serve more relevant ads to people.\n\nWe talked about the introduction of the new GEM ads recommendation model in\nQ1. And we have talked about some of the prior model architecture\nimprovements like Lattice and Andromeda in past quarters. For us, we really\nbelieve, first and foremost, that advertising is a relative performance\ngame. That's especially important for us because the vast majority of our\nbusiness is direct response advertising. So we feel good about how the\nprior investments are paying off and we continue to invest in a lot of\ndifferent work to constantly improve our ads ranking and recommendations\nperformance.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Kenneth Gawrelski with Wells\nFargo.\n\nKenneth James Gawrelski\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\n\nTwo for me, please. First, maybe, Mark, how should we think about the\ntiming of AI capabilities necessary to drive WhatsApp for business adoption\nin higher labor -- cost labor markets? What is Meta doing to accelerate\nthat adoption? And do you see this as mostly incremental to SME ad spend\nthat you're already capturing? And then for Susan, one, please. What does\nthe revised CapEx outlook for this year for '25 mean about future years?\nDoes it mean anything? Or you talked about this being an acceleration in\nyour revised outlook statement. Should we think about this as a new\nstarting point for -- to think about '26 and beyond? Or should we just\nstart fresh in '26 and think about the needs and capacity at that point?\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nI'm happy to take -- I'll go ahead and take both of those. And Mark, you\nshould feel free to chime in wherever you would like. So Mark talked a\nlittle bit about our general vision that every business will soon have an\nAI that is an expert in their business for their customers to talk to in\nthe same way that today they've got e-mail and websites, social media\npresences, et cetera. We are currently testing business AIs with a limited\nset of businesses in the U.S. and a few additional countries on WhatsApp,\nMessenger and on ads on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nWe've been starting with small business and focusing first on helping them\nsell their goods and services with business AIs. But ultimately, we are\nworking on tools to support businesses at every stage of the customer\nfunnel from lead generation to order management and customer service. And a\ncore area that we're addressing right now is really the ability for\nbusinesses to customize and control the agent to achieve the outcome that\nthey want.\n\nSo we've launched a new agent management experience and dashboard that\nmakes it easier for businesses to train their AI based on existing\ninformation on their website or WhatsApp profile or their Instagram and\nFacebook pages. And we're starting with the ability for businesses to\nactivate AI in their chats with customers. We are also testing business AIs\non Facebook and Instagram ads that you can ask about product and return\npolicies or assist you in making a purchase within our in-app browser.\n\nSo again, the ultimate vision is to build an experience that serves\ncustomers across all of these different services and apps. No matter where\nyou engage with the business AI, it should be one agent that recalls your\nhistory and your preferences. And we're hearing encouraging feedback,\nparticularly that adopting these AIs are saving the business that we're\ntesting with a lot of time and helping to determine which conversations\nmake sense for them to spend more time on.\n\nAnd then your second question, right, was about 2026 CapEx. Infrastructure,\nas I alluded to earlier, just is a very dynamic planning area given the\ncontinued advances in AI and also for us, the fact that we continue to find\na lot of good use cases to put capacity toward in our core AI ranking and\nrecommendations work. So I would say it's too early to discuss plans beyond\n2025.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Truist\nSecurities.\n\nYoussef Houssaini Squali\nTruist Securities, Inc., Research Division\n\nSo Mark, in a world where we now have maybe 5 to 10 chatbots, including\nMeta AI on our smartphone is doing virtually the same thing, do you think\nthis is a market much like Search where the winner takes most or is it\nlikely to be much more fragmented? But in either case, what would you say\nare the top 2 or 3 competitive advantages of Meta AI? And then, Susan, on\nthe EU decision in connection with the DMA, what kind of modifications will\nyou need to make to the apps? And can you maybe just help us gauge the\npotential financial fallout, understanding that it may obviously be too\nearly?\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nYes. On Meta AI, I mean, I think that there are going to be a number of\ndifferent agents that people use, just like people use different apps for\ndifferent things. I'm not sure that people are going to use multiple agents\nfor the same exact things, but I'd imagine that something that is more\nfocused on kind of enterprise productivity might be different from\nsomething that is somewhat more optimized for personal productivity. And\nthat might be somewhat different from something that is optimized for\nentertainment and social connectivity. So I think there will be different\nexperiences.\n\nOne of the trends that I think we're starting to see now is personalization\nacross these. Right now, if the experience is unpersonalized, then you can\nkind of just go to different apps and get reasonably similar answers to\ndifferent questions. But once an AI starts getting to know you and what you\ncare about in context and can build up memory from the conversations that\nyou've had with it over time, I think that will start to become somewhat\nmore of a differentiator. So that's one thing that we think will matter.\n\nAnd then, of course, there's all the different modalities. Being able to\nnot just answer questions about in text but being able to do voice and\nmultimodal and be able to produce images and videos and understand all\nthose things and have good conversations about that, I think, is going to\nbe important overall. So yes, I mean, I think Meta AI is well positioned,\nbut we have a lot of work to do in order to make it the leading personal\nAI.\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nAnd Youssef, on your second question, it is really too early to speak about\nwhat those changes could be because we are in the process of engaging with\nthe European Commission. I think maybe the most useful sort of metric I\ncould give you is just that our advertising revenue in the European\neconomic area in Switzerland, which would be the geographies impacted here,\nwas 16% of our worldwide total revenue in 2024. Again, we are continuing to\nengage actively with the European Commission further on this, so we hope to\nhave more clarity by next quarter's call.\n\nKenneth J. Dorell\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nKrista, we have time for one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour last question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.\n\nMark Stephen F. Mahaney\nEvercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division\n\nI'll just throw in 2. I think you called out that the China-based retailers\nas one sort of potentially soft advertising vertical. Anything else you'd\ncall out? And I would just suggest autos. Is that an area of any softness?\nAnd then on the Reality Labs and on the losses associated with Reality\nLabs, they've been very consistent, whatever, $4 billion a quarter for\nquite some time. Is there light at the end of the tunnel? Is there a reason\nto think -- is there a factor that would occur that would cause those\nlosses to come down? And when would that be? But maybe more importantly,\nwhat is going to cause those losses to come down?\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nMark, let me take your first question about other verticals. We generally\nsaw healthy growth in most verticals in Q1. We did see some weakness in\ngaming and politics. So year-over-year growth in gaming was negative in Q1\nas we lapped a period of strong spend from China-based advertisers that\nwere promoting a larger volume of game titles in Q1 of 2024. And then year-\nover-year growth in the government and politics vertical dropped sharply as\nexpected with the conclusion of U.S. elections, but that continues to just\nbe a very small vertical overall. And then your second question on Reality\nLabs -- yes.\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nYes, Reality Labs one. I mean we're basically focused on doing the work\nmore efficiently. But as the AI glasses have really taken off -- I've\ntalked about this on a number of calls. There are more investments that I\nthink makes sense to make around making sure that we can distribute this\nand grow it very quickly. I mean some of the -- if you look at some of the\nleading consumer electronics products of other categories, by the time they\nget to their third generation, they're often selling 10 million units and\nscaling from there. And I'm not sure if we're going to do exactly that, but\nI think that that's like the ballpark of the opportunity that we have. And\nthat's something that I think we're kind of focused on scaling to that and\nthen scaling beyond that for the generations after that.\n\nSo I think some of the effort that we're doing is going to -- we're going\nto get more efficient in some parts of the work that we do. But then as a\nbunch of the products start to hit and start to grow even bigger than the\nnumber that I just said is just sort of like the sort of a near-term\nmilestone, then I think we'll continue scaling in terms of distribution.\nAnd then at some point, just like the other products that we build out, we\nwill feel like we're at a sufficient scale that we're going to primarily\nfocus on making sure that we're monetizing and building an efficient\nbusiness around it. But that's kind of where we're at on it. We're\ndefinitely focused on doing the work more efficiently but also very\noptimistic about what we're seeing in the results, especially on the AI\nglasses side.\n\nKenneth J. Dorell\nDirector of Investor RelationsGreat.

      "role": "Founder, Chairman & CEO",
      "text": "Founder, Chairman & CEO All right. Thanks, Ken. Thanks, everyone, for joining today. We've had a strong start to the year. Our community keeps growing with more than 3.4 billion people now using at least one of our apps each day. Our business is also performing very well, and I think we're well positioned to navigate the macroeconomic uncertainty. The major theme right now, of course, is how AI is transforming everything we do. And as we continue to increase our investments and focus more of our resources on AI, I thought it would be useful today to lay out the 5 major opportunities that we are focused on. Those are improved advertising, more engaging experiences, business messaging, Meta AI and AI devices. And these are each long-term investments that are downstream from us building general intelligence and leading AI models and infrastructure. Even with our significant investments, we don't need to succeed in all of these areas to have a good ROI. But if we do, then I think that we will be wildly happy with the investments that we are making. The first opportunity is improved advertising. Our goal is to make it so that any business can basically tell us what objective they're trying to achieve like selling something or getting a new customer and how much they're willing to pay for each result and then we just do the rest. Businesses used to have to generate their own ad creative and define what audiences they wanted to reach, but AI has already made us better at targeting and finding the audiences that will be interested in their products than many businesses are themselves, and that keeps improving. And now AI is generating better creative options for many businesses as well. I think that this is really redefining what advertising is into an AI agent that delivers measurable business results at scale. And if we deliver on this vision, then over the coming years, I think that the increased productivity from AI will make advertising a meaningfully larger share of global GDP than it is today. In just the last quarter, we are testing a new ads recommendation model for Reels, which has already increased conversion rates by 5%. And we're seeing 30% more advertisers are using AI creative tools in the last quarter as well. The second opportunity is more engaging experiences. This will come in 2 forms: better recommendations for existing content types and better new types of content. In the last 6 months, improvements to our recommendation systems have led to a 7% increase in time spent on Facebook, 6% increase on Instagram and 35% on Threads. Threads now also has more than 350 million monthly actives and continues to be on track to become our next major social app. In addition to better recommendations for existing content types, AI is also enabling the creation of better content as well. Some of this will be helping people produce better content to share themselves. Some of this will be AI generating content directly for people that is personalized for them. Some of this will be in existing formats like photos and videos, and some of it will be increasingly interactive. I've often talked about this long-term trend of content becoming richer over time. Our feeds started mostly with text and then became mostly photos when we all got mobile phones with cameras and then became mostly video when mobile networks became fast enough to handle that well. We are now in the video era, but I don't think that this is the end of the line. In the near future, I think that we're going to have content in our feeds that you can interact with and that it will interact back with you rather than you just watching it. Over the long term, as AI unlocks more productivity in the economy, I also expect that people will spend more of their time on entertainment and culture, which will create an even larger opportunity to create more engaging experiences across all of these apps. The third opportunity is business messaging. Right now, the vast majority of our business is advertising and feeds on Facebook and Instagram. But WhatsApp now has more than 3 billion monthly actives with more than 100 million people in the U.S. and growing quickly there. Messenger is also used by more than 1 billion people each month, and there are now as many messages sent each day on Instagram as there are on Messenger. So business messaging should be the next pillar of our business. In countries like Thailand and Vietnam, where there is a low cost of labor, we see many businesses conduct commerce through our messaging apps. There's actually so much business through messaging that those countries are both in our top 10 or 11 by revenue even though they're ranked in the 30s in global GDP. This phenomenon hasn't yet spread to developed countries because the cost of labor is too high to make this a profitable model before AI, but AI should solve this. So in the next few years, I expect that just like every business today has an e-mail address, social media account and website, they'll also have an AI business agent that can do customer support and sales. And they should be able to set that up very easily given all the context that they've already put into our business platforms. And we're going to have more to share on upcoming calls about our progress in this area. The fourth opportunity is Meta AI. Across our apps, there are now almost 1 billion monthly actives using Meta AI. Our focus for this year is deepening the experience and making AI the leading personal AI with an emphasis on personalization, voice conversations and entertainment. I think that we're all going to have an AI that we talk to throughout the day, while we're browsing content on our phones, and eventually, as we're going through our days with glasses. And I think that this is going to be one of the most important and valuable services that has ever been created. In addition to building Meta AI into our apps, we just released our first Meta AI stand-alone app. It is personalized. So you can talk to it about interests that you've shown while browsing Reels or different content across our apps. And we built a social feed into it. So you can discover entertaining ways that others are using Meta AI. And initial feedback on the app has been good so far. Over time, I expect the business opportunity for Meta AI to follow our normal product development playbook. First, we build and scale the product. And then once it is at scale, then we focus on revenue. In this case, I think that there will be a large opportunity to show product recommendations or ads as well as a premium service for people who want to unlock more compute for additional functionality or intelligence. But I expect that we're going to be largely focused on scaling and deepening engagement for at least the next year before we'll really be ready to start building out the business here. The fifth opportunity is AI devices, which is increasingly how we are thinking about our work on the next generation of computing platforms. Glasses are the ideal form factor for both AI and the metaverse. They enable you to let an AI see what you see, hear what you hear and talk to you throughout the day. And they let you blend the physical and digital worlds together with holograms. More than 1 billion people worldwide wear glasses today, and it seems highly likely that these will become AI glasses over the next 5 to 10 years. Building the devices that people use to experience our services lets us deliver the highest-quality AI and social experiences. And this will serve as an amplifier on all of the opportunities I've mentioned so far as well as unlocking some new opportunities as well. Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses have tripled in sales in the last year. The people who have them are using them a lot. We've got some exciting new launches with our partner, EssilorLuxottica, later this year as well that should expand that category and add some new technological capabilities to the glasses. On Quest, we are also seeing deeper engagement as Quest 3S makes VR accessible to more people, and more people are creating experiences in horizon with AI tools. Now everything that I've talked about today is built on top of our AI models and our infrastructure. We released the first Llama 4 models earlier this month. They are some of the most intelligent, best multimodal, lowest latency and most efficient models that anyone has built. We have more models on the way, including the massive Llama 4 Behemoth model. Overall, we are focused on building full general intelligence. All of the opportunities that I've discussed today are downstream of delivering general intelligence and doing so efficiently. The pace of progress across the industry and the opportunities ahead for us are staggering. I want to make sure that we're working aggressively and efficiently. And I also want to make sure that we are building out the leading infrastructure and teams that we need to achieve our goals. So to that end, we are accelerating some of our efforts to bring capacity online more quickly this year as well as some longer-term projects that will give us the flexibility to add capacity in the coming years as well. And that has increased our planned investment for this year. More broadly, this has been a good start to what I expect will continue to be an intense year. We've got a lot more exciting work in the pipeline that I'm looking forward to sharing soon. I continue to think that this year is going to be a pivotal moment for our industry, and I am grateful for everyone who is working so hard at the company to deliver all of this amazing technology and new experiences. As always, thank you all for being on this journey with us. And now, Susan.",

      "text": "Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. Q1 total revenue was $42.3 billion, up 16% or 19% on a constant currency basis. Q1 total expenses were $24.8 billion, up 9% compared to last year. In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased 14%, driven primarily by higher infrastructure costs and payments to partners, partially offset by a benefit from the previously announced extension of server useful lives. R&D increased 22%, mostly due to higher employee compensation and infrastructure costs. Marketing and sales increased 8%, driven mainly by an increase in professional services related to our ongoing platform integrity efforts. G&A decreased 34%, driven primarily by lower legal-related costs. We ended Q1 with over 76,800 employees, up 4% quarter-over-quarter. First quarter operating income was $17.6 billion, representing a 41% operating margin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 9% as we recognized excess tax benefits from share-based compensation due to the increase in our share price versus prior periods. Net [Audio Gap] expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases were $13.7 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure. Free cash flow was $10.3 billion. We repurchased $13.4 billion of our Class A common stock and paid $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders, ending the quarter with $70.2 billion in cash and marketable securities and $28.8 billion in debt. Moving now to our segment results. I'll begin with our Family of Apps segment. Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow, and we estimate more than 3.4 billion people used at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in March. Q1 total Family of Apps revenue was $41.9 billion, up 16% year-over-year. Q1 Family of Apps ad revenue was $41.4 billion, up 16% or 20% on a constant currency basis. Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth. On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Rest of World and North America at 19% and 18%, respectively. Europe and Asia Pacific grew 14% and 12%. In Q1, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 5%, and the average price per ad increased 10%. Impression growth was mainly driven by Asia Pacific. Pricing growth benefited from increased advertiser demand, in part driven by improved ad performance. This was partially offset by impression growth, particularly from lower monetizing regions and surfaces. Family of Apps other revenue was $510 million, up 34%, driven mostly by business messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp business platform as well as Meta verified subscriptions. We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps. In Q1, Family of Apps expenses were $20.1 billion, representing 81% of our overall expenses. Family of Apps expenses were up 10%, mainly due to growth in employee compensation and infrastructure costs, which were partially offset by lower legal-related expenses. Family of Apps operating income was $21.8 billion, representing a 52% operating margin. Within our Reality Labs segment, Q1 revenue was $412 million, down 6% year- over-year due to lower Meta Quest sales, which were partially offset by increased sales of Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses. Reality Labs expenses were $4.6 billion, up 8% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher employee compensation. Reality Labs operating loss was $4.2 billion. Turning now to the business outlook. There are 2 primary factors that drive our revenue performance: our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time. On the first, we're focused both on enhancing our core Family of Apps today and building the next generation of devices and experiences through Reality Labs. I'll start with our Family of Apps. In the first quarter, we saw strong growth in video consumption across both Facebook and Instagram, particularly in the U.S., where video time spent grew double digits year- over-year. This growth continues to be driven primarily by ongoing enhancements to our recommendation systems, and we see opportunities to deliver further gains this year. We're also progressing on longer-term efforts to develop innovative new approaches to recommendations. A big focus of this work will be on developing increasingly efficient recommendation systems so that we can continue scaling up the complexity and compute used to train our models while avoiding diminishing returns. There are promising techniques we're working on that will incorporate the innovations from LLM model architectures to achieve this. Another area that is showing early promise is integrating LLM technology into our content recommendation systems. For example, we're finding that LLM's ability to understand a piece of content more deeply than traditional recommendation systems can help better identify what is interesting to someone about a piece of content, leading to better recommendations. We began testing using Llama in Threads recommendation systems at the end of last year given the app's text-based content and have already seen a 4% lift in time spent from the first launch. It remains early here, but a big focus this year will be on exploring how we can deploy this for other content types, including photos and videos. We also expect this to be complementary to Meta AI as it can provide more relevant responses to people's queries by better understanding their interests and preferences through their interactions across Facebook, Instagram and Threads. Earlier this year, we began testing the ability for Meta AI to better personalize its responses by remembering certain details from people's prior queries and considering what that person engages with on our apps. We are already seeing this lead to deeper engagement with people we've rolled it out to, and it is now built into Meta AI across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and our new stand-alone Meta AI app in the U.S. and Canada. We're also continuing to focus on helping people connect over content. In Q1, we launched a new experience on Instagram in the U.S. that consists of a feed of content your friends have left a note on or liked, and we're seeing good results. We also just launched Blend, which is an opt-in experience in direct messages that enables you to blend your Reels algorithm with your friends to spark conversations over each other's interest. These features all lean into Instagram's position at the intersection of entertainment and social connection. WhatsApp remains, at its core, a private messaging app. But it has evolved to also become a place people come to get updates from accounts they are connected to or follow. Today, there are tens of billions of views of status posts on WhatsApp each day, and we continue to invest in the updates tab as a place people can go to do more. Creators remain another big focus for us and we're investing in tools to help them produce the best original content on our platforms. Last week, we launched our stand-alone Edits app, which supports the full creative process for video creators from inspiration and creation to performance insights. Edits has an ultra-high resolution, short-form video camera and includes generative AI tools that enable people to remove the background of any video or animate still images with more features coming soon. Moving to Reality Labs. We're seeing very strong traction with Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses with over 4x as many monthly actives as a year ago. And the number of people using voice commands is growing even faster as people use it to answer questions and control their glasses. This month, we fully rolled out live translations on Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses to all markets for English, French, Italian and Spanish. Now when you are speaking to someone in one of these languages, you'll hear what they say in your preferred language through the glasses in real time. Now to the second driver of our revenue performance, increasing monetization efficiency. The first part of this work is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement. We continue to optimize ad supply across each service to better deliver ads at the time and place they are most relevant to people. We are also starting to introduce ads on unmonetized surfaces like Threads, which we opened up to all eligible advertisers this month to reach people in over 30 different markets to start, including the U.S. As we do for any newly monetized surface, we expect to gradually ramp ad supply as we optimize the ad formats and ensure they feel native to the app. We don't expect Threads to be a meaningful driver of overall impression or revenue growth in 2025. The second part of increasing monetization efficiency is improving marketing performance. We're continuing to improve our ad systems by developing new modeling technologies to more efficiently predict the right ad to show. In Q1, we introduced our new Generative Ads Recommendation Model, or GEM, for ads ranking. This model uses a new architecture we developed that is twice as efficient at improving ad performance for a given amount of data and compute. This efficiency gain enabled us to significantly scale up the amount of compute we use for model training with GEM trained on thousands of GPUs, our largest cluster for ads training to date. We began testing the new model for ads recommendations on Facebook Reels earlier this year and have seen up to a 5% increase in ad conversions. We're now rolling it out to additional surfaces across our apps. On the ads product side, we're seeing continued momentum with our Advantage+ suite of AI-powered solutions. We've been encouraged by the initial test of our streamlined campaign creation flow for sales, app and lead campaigns, which starts with Advantage+ turned on from the beginning for advertisers. In April, we rolled this out to more advertisers and expect to complete the global rollout later this year. We're also seeing strong adoption of Advantage+ Creative. This week, we are broadening access of video expansion to Facebook Reels for all eligible advertisers, enabling them to automatically adjust the aspect ratio of their existing videos by generating new pixels in each frame to optimize their ads for full screen surfaces. We also rolled out image generation to all eligible advertisers. And this quarter, we plan to continue testing a new virtual try-on feature that uses gen AI to place clothing on virtual models, helping customers visualize how an item may look and fit. Last, we continue to evolve our ads platform to drive results that are optimized for each business' objectives and the way they measure value. One example of this is our incremental attribution feature, which enables advertisers to optimize for driving incremental conversions or conversions we believe would not have occurred without an ad being shown. We're seeing strong results in testing so far with advertisers using incremental attribution in tests seeing an average 46% lift in incremental conversions compared to their business-as-usual approach. We expect to make this available to all advertisers in the coming weeks. Next, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. Our primary focus remains investing capital back into the business with infrastructure and talent being our top priorities. Starting with headcount, our hiring continues to be targeted at technical roles within our company priorities. In the first quarter, the significant majority of the roughly 2,800 employees we added were to support our priorities of monetization, infrastructure, generative AI, regulation and compliance and Reality Labs. On infrastructure, we have 2 primary focuses to meet the growing compute needs of our services and AI initiatives. The first way is by significantly scaling up our infrastructure footprint. Our CapEx growth this year is going toward both generative AI and core business needs with the majority of overall CapEx supporting the core. We expect the significant infrastructure footprint we are building will not only help us meet the demands of our business in the near term but also provide us an advantage in the quality and scale of AI services we can deliver. We continue to build this capacity in a way that grants us maximum flexibility in how and when we deploy it to ensure we have the agility to react to how the technology and industry develop in the coming years. The second way we're meeting our compute needs is by increasing the efficiency of our workloads. In fact, many of the innovations coming out of our ranking work are focused on increasing the efficiency of our systems. This emphasis on efficiency is helping us deliver consistently strong returns from our core AI initiatives. For example, we shared on the Q3 2024 call that improvements to our AI-driven feed and video recommendations drove a roughly 8% lift in time spent on Facebook and a 6% lift on Instagram over the first 9 months of last year. Since then, we've been able to deliver similar gains in just 6 months' time with improvements to our AI recommendations delivering 7% and 6% time spent gains on Facebook and Instagram, respectively. Before moving to our financial guidance, I want to acknowledge the dynamic macro environment and note that our range reflects the potential for a wider set of outcomes. We continue to feel good about the fundamental drivers of revenue growth and believe the past work we've done to streamline our operations and cost profile puts us in a strong position to navigate a variety of outcomes. Moving to our financial outlook. We expect second quarter 2025 total revenue to be in the range of $42.5 billion to $45.5 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is an approximately 1% tailwind to year-over-year total revenue growth based on current exchange rates. Turning now to the expense outlook. We expect full year 2025 total expenses to be in the range of $113 million to $118 billion, lowered from our prior outlook of $114 billion to $119 billion. Turning now to the CapEx outlook. We anticipate our full year 2025 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, will be in the range of $64 billion to $72 billion, increased from our prior outlook of $60 billion to $65 billion. This updated outlook reflects additional data center investments to support our AI efforts as well as an increase in the expected cost of infrastructure hardware. The majority of our CapEx in 2025 will continue to be directed to our core business. On to tax. Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full year 2025 tax rate to be in the range of 12% to 15%. In addition, we continue to monitor an active regular landscape, including legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results. The European Commission recently announced its decision that our subscription for no ads model is not compliant with the DMA. Based on feedback from the European Commission in connection with the DMA, we expect we will need to make some modifications to our model, which could result in a materially worse user experience for European users and a significant impact to our European business and revenue as early as the third quarter of 2025. We will appeal the commission's DMA decision, but any modifications to our model may be imposed before or during the appeal process. In closing, this was another solid quarter for our business. We believe the investments we're making across our company priorities will position us well in the coming years to continue delivering engaging services for our community, compelling results for advertisers and strong business performance. With that, Krista, let's open up the call for questions. Question and Answer",

      "text": "Founder, Chairman & CEO Sure. I can talk about the LLMs. On the Meta AI usage, I'm not sure if we have more stats to share on that now. Yes, it's -- I'll defer to Susan if there's anything that we're ready on that. On the LLM, yes, there's a lot of progress being made in a lot of different dimensions. And the reason why we want to build this out is -- one is that we think it's important that for kind of how critical this is for our business that we sort of have control of our own destiny and are not depending on another company for something so critical. But two, we want to make sure that we can shape the development to be optimized for our infrastructure and the use cases that we want. So to that end, Llama 4, the shape of the model with 17 billion parameters per expert was designed specifically for the infrastructure that we have in order to provide the low latency experience to be voice optimized. One of the key things, if you're having a voice conversation with AI, is it needs to be low latency. So that way, when you're having a conversation with it, there's isn't a large gap between when you stop speaking and it starts. So everything from the shape of the model to the research that we're doing to techniques that go into it are kind of fit into that. Similarly, another thing that we focused on was context window length. And in some of our models, we have really -- we're industry-leading on context window length. And part of the reason why we think that that's important is because we're very focused on providing a personalized experience. And there are different ways that you can put personalization context into an LLM, but one of the ways to do it is to include some of that context in the context window. And having a long context window that can incorporate a lot of the background that the person has shared across our apps is one way to do that. So that's like -- it kind of is giving you a flavor of the products that we're trying to build and then some specific technical architecture decisions and research prioritization that we basically have made in order to deliver the specific experience that we're going for. I could go on and add a lot more. The reason I think it's also very important to deliver big models like Behemoth, not because we're going to end up serving them in production, but because of the technique of distilling from larger models, right? The Llama 4 models that we've published so far and the ones that we're using internally and some of the ones that we'll build in the future are basically distilled from the Behemoth model in order to get the 90%, 95% of the intelligence of the large model in a form factor that is much lower latency and much more efficient. So these things are all very important. Obviously, we wouldn't be able to do that kind of distillation from other closed models. So that kind of gives you a flavor for how we're thinking about the development of this. And then, of course, the models and the infrastructure that we're building out power all of the opportunities that I mentioned before.",

The top use case right now for Meta AI from a query perspective is really around information gathering as people are using it to search for and understand and analyze information followed by social interactions from -- ranging from casual chatting to more in-depth discussion or debate. We also see people use it for writing assistance, interacting with visual content, seeking help. And we see Meta -- people engage with Meta AI from several different entry points. WhatsApp continues to see the strongest Meta AI usage across our Family of Apps. Most of that WhatsApp engagement is in one-on-one Threads, followed by Facebook, which is the second largest driver of Meta AI engagement, where we're seeing strong engagement from our feed deep dives integration that lets people ask Meta AI questions about the content that's recommended to them.

I think some people want faster access to it or a more built-out feature set than you can build into an app like WhatsApp. So the stand-alone app will be valuable for that. I also think that the stand-alone app is going to be particularly important in the United States because WhatsApp, as Susan said, is the largest surface that people use Meta AI and which makes sense. If you want to text an AI, having that be closely integrated and a good experience in the messaging app that you use makes a lot of sense. But we're -- while we have more than 100 million people use WhatsApp in the United States, we're clearly not the primary messaging app in the United States at this point. iMessage is. We hope to become the leader over time. But we're in a different position there than we are in most of the rest of the world on WhatsApp. So I think that the Meta AI app as a stand-alone is going to be particularly important in the United States to establishing leadership in -- as the main personal AI that people use.

On the Q2 guide, there's uncertainty, obviously, in how the macro environment will evolve over time and how that could impact different segments of our business. Our Q2 revenue outlook aims to factor that in. And partly -- that's partly why the $3 billion range reflects the potential for a wider range of outcomes. Specifically, we have seen some reduced spend in the U.S. from Asia-based e-commerce exporters, which we believe is in anticipation of the de minimis exemption going away on May 2. A portion of that spend has been redirected to other markets, but overall spend for those advertisers is below the levels prior to April. But our Q2 outlook reflects the trends we're seeing so far in April, which have generally been healthy. So it's very early. Hard to know how things will play out over the quarter and certainly harder to know that for the rest of the year. Your second question is about why we're investing more in CapEx. And we really believe that our ability to build world-class infrastructure gives us a meaningful advantage in both developing the leading AI technology and services over the coming years. And there are a lot of opportunities also for us to improve our core business by putting more compute against our ads and recommendation work. So even with the capacity that we're bringing online in 2025, we are having a hard time meeting the demand that teams have for compute resources across the company. So we are going to continually invest meaningfully here across our infrastructure footprint, but we are also really looking to build this capacity in a way that gives us the maximum flexibility in how and when we deploy it over the coming years so we can respond to how the market and technology develop.",

On the first question, the capacity landscape we are in is pretty dynamic, both in terms of the many moving parts in terms of us bringing capacity online but also in terms of the demand from different product groups in our company, whether they are in the gen AI teams or whether they're doing more of the core AI work around ranking and recommendations. So both the supply and demand are quite fluid. And so we don't have a sort of fixed answer in terms of when we expect that we will sort of have enough supply to meet all demand. But that's something that we are working very hard to alleviate, and it's part of why we accelerated bringing more data center space online this year. And also, we're very focused on increasing the efficiency of our workloads over the course of the year. On your second question about ads, performance ads ranking, we have invested for many years and continue to invest in driving ad performance improvements. Year-over-year conversion growth remains strong. And in fact, we continue to see conversions grow at a faster rate than ad impressions in Q1, so reflecting increased conversion rates. And ads ranking and modeling improvements are a big driver of overall performance gains. We have a lot of innovations and model architecture in both the ads retrieval and ranking stages of the ads delivery process to serve more relevant ads to people. We talked about the introduction of the new GEM ads recommendation model in Q1. And we have talked about some of the prior model architecture improvements like Lattice and Andromeda in past quarters. For us, we really believe, first and foremost, that advertising is a relative performance game. That's especially important for us because the vast majority of our business is direct response advertising.

What is Meta doing to accelerate that adoption? And do you see this as mostly incremental to SME ad spend that you're already capturing? And then for Susan, one, please. What does the revised CapEx outlook for this year for '25 mean about future years? Does it mean anything? Or you talked about this being an acceleration in your revised outlook statement. Should we think about this as a new starting point for -- to think about '26 and beyond? Or should we just start fresh in '26 and think about the needs and capacity at that point?",

      "text": "Chief Financial Officer I'm happy to take -- I'll go ahead and take both of those. And Mark, you should feel free to chime in wherever you would like. So Mark talked a little bit about our general vision that every business will soon have an AI that is an expert in their business for their customers to talk to in the same way that today they've got e-mail and websites, social media presences, et cetera. We are currently testing business AIs with a limited set of businesses in the U.S. and a few additional countries on WhatsApp, Messenger and on ads on Facebook and Instagram. We've been starting with small business and focusing first on helping them sell their goods and services with business AIs. But ultimately, we are working on tools to support businesses at every stage of the customer funnel from lead generation to order management and customer service. And a core area that we're addressing right now is really the ability for businesses to customize and control the agent to achieve the outcome that they want. So we've launched a new agent management experience and dashboard that makes it easier for businesses to train their AI based on existing information on their website or WhatsApp profile or their Instagram and Facebook pages. And we're starting with the ability for businesses to activate AI in their chats with customers. We are also testing business AIs on Facebook and Instagram ads that you can ask about product and return policies or assist you in making a purchase within our in-app browser. So again, the ultimate vision is to build an experience that serves customers across all of these different services and apps. No matter where you engage with the business AI, it should be one agent that recalls your history and your preferences. And we're hearing encouraging feedback, particularly that adopting these AIs are saving the business that we're testing with a lot of time and helping to determine which conversations make sense for them to spend more time on. And then your second question, right, was about 2026 CapEx. Infrastructure, as I alluded to earlier, just is a very dynamic planning area given the continued advances in AI and also for us, the fact that we continue to find a lot of good use cases to put capacity toward in our core AI ranking and recommendations work. So I would say it's too early to discuss plans beyond 2025.",

But in either case, what would you say are the top 2 or 3 competitive advantages of Meta AI? And then, Susan, on the EU decision in connection with the DMA, what kind of modifications will you need to make to the apps? And can you maybe just help us gauge the potential financial fallout, understanding that it may obviously be too early?",

      "text": "Founder, Chairman & CEO Yes. On Meta AI, I mean, I think that there are going to be a number of different agents that people use, just like people use different apps for different things. I'm not sure that people are going to use multiple agents for the same exact things, but I'd imagine that something that is more focused on kind of enterprise productivity might be different from something that is somewhat more optimized for personal productivity. And that might be somewhat different from something that is optimized for entertainment and social connectivity. So I think there will be different experiences. One of the trends that I think we're starting to see now is personalization across these. Right now, if the experience is unpersonalized, then you can kind of just go to different apps and get reasonably similar answers to different questions. But once an AI starts getting to know you and what you care about in context and can build up memory from the conversations that you've had with it over time, I think that will start to become somewhat more of a differentiator. So that's one thing that we think will matter. And then, of course, there's all the different modalities. Being able to not just answer questions about in text but being able to do voice and multimodal and be able to produce images and videos and understand all those things and have good conversations about that, I think, is going to be important overall. So yes, I mean, I think Meta AI is well positioned, but we have a lot of work to do in order to make it the leading personal AI.",

I think maybe the most useful sort of metric I could give you is just that our advertising revenue in the European economic area in Switzerland, which would be the geographies impacted here, was 16% of our worldwide total revenue in 2024. Again, we are continuing to engage actively with the European Commission further on this, so we hope to have more clarity by next quarter's call.",

Anything else you'd call out? And I would just suggest autos. Is that an area of any softness? And then on the Reality Labs and on the losses associated with Reality Labs, they've been very consistent, whatever, $4 billion a quarter for quite some time. Is there light at the end of the tunnel? Is there a reason to think -- is there a factor that would occur that would cause those losses to come down? And when would that be?

We did see some weakness in gaming and politics. So year-over-year growth in gaming was negative in Q1 as we lapped a period of strong spend from China-based advertisers that were promoting a larger volume of game titles in Q1 of 2024. And then year- over-year growth in the government and politics vertical dropped sharply as expected with the conclusion of U.S. elections, but that continues to just be a very small vertical overall. And then your second question on Reality Labs -- yes.",

But as the AI glasses have really taken off -- I've talked about this on a number of calls. There are more investments that I think makes sense to make around making sure that we can distribute this and grow it very quickly. I mean some of the -- if you look at some of the leading consumer electronics products of other categories, by the time they get to their third generation, they're often selling 10 million units and scaling from there. And I'm not sure if we're going to do exactly that, but I think that that's like the ballpark of the opportunity that we have. And that's something that I think we're kind of focused on scaling to that and then scaling beyond that for the generations after that. So I think some of the effort that we're doing is going to -- we're going to get more efficient in some parts of the work that we do. But then as a bunch of the products start to hit and start to grow even bigger than the number that I just said is just sort of like the sort of a near-term milestone, then I think we'll continue scaling in terms of distribution. And then at some point, just like the other products that we build out, we will feel like we're at a sufficient scale that we're going to primarily focus on making sure that we're monetizing and building an efficient business around it. But that's kind of where we're at on it. We're definitely focused on doing the work more efficiently but also very optimistic about what we're seeing in the results, especially on the AI glasses side.",
