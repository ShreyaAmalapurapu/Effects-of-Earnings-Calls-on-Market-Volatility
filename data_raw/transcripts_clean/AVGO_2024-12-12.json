NasdaqGS:AVGO\nFQ4 2024 Earnings Call Transcripts\nThursday, December 12, 2024 10:00 PM GMT\nS&P Global Market Intelligence Estimates\n\nPresentation\n\nOperator\n\nWelcome to the Broadcom Inc.'s Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2024\nFinancial Results Conference Call. At this time, for opening remarks and\nintroductions, I would like to turn the call over Ji Yoo, Head of Investor\nRelations of Broadcom Inc.\n\nJi Yoo\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today's call\nare Hock Tan, President and CEO; Kirsten Spears, Chief Financial Officer;\nand Charlie Kawwas, President, Semiconductor Solutions Group.\n\nBroadcom distributed a press release and financial tables after the market\nclosed, describing our financial performance for the fourth quarter and\nfiscal year 2024. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the\ninformation from the Investors section of Broadcom's website at\nbroadcom.com.\n\nThis conference call is being webcast live and an audio replay of the\nconference call can be accessed for 1 year through the Investors section of\nBroadcom's website. During the prepared comments, Hock and Kirsten will be\nproviding details of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 results,\nguidance for our first quarter of fiscal year 2025 as well as commentary\nregarding the business environment.\n\nWe'll take questions after the end of our prepared comments. Please refer\nto our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for\ninformation on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual\nresults to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on\nthis call.\n\nIn addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial\nmeasures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP\nmeasures is included in the tables attached to today's press release.\nComments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP\nfinancial results.\n\nI will now turn the call over to Hock.\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nThank you, Ji, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Well, this\nhas been a transformative year for Broadcom. Our fiscal year 2024\nconsolidated revenue grew 44% year-over-year to a record $51.6 billion. Now\nexcluding VMware, our revenue grew over 9% organically. So fiscal '24\noperating profit, excluding transition costs, grew 42% year-over-year, and\nwe returned a record $22 billion in cash to our shareholders, up 45% year-\non-year through dividends, buybacks and eliminations.\n\nThere were 2 significant drivers of this transformation this year. First,\nwe closed the acquisition of VMware in the early weeks of fiscal '24 and\nhave focused VMware on its technology leadership in data center\nvirtualization. The integration of VMware is largely complete. Revenue is\non a growth trajectory, and operating margin reached 70% exiting 2024.\n\nWe are well on the path to delivering incremental adjusted EBITDA at a\nlevel that significantly exceeds the $8.5 billion we communicated when we\nannounced the deal. We're planning to achieve this much earlier than our\ninitial target of 3 years.\n\nThe second driver in 2024 was AI. Our AI revenue, which came from strength\nin custom AI accelerators, or XPUs, and networking grew 220% from $3.8\nbillion in fiscal '23 to $12.2 billion in fiscal '24 and represented 41% of\nour semiconductor revenue. This drove semiconductor revenue up to a record\n$30.1 billion during the year.\n\nOkay. Now let's move on to the fourth quarter and give you more color.\nConsolidated net revenue of $14.1 billion was up 51% year-on-year.\nExcluding VMware, organic growth was 11%. And operating profit of $8.8\nbillion was up 53% year-on-year.\n\nFor the details on infrastructure software in Q4, this infrastructure\nsoftware segment revenue was $5.8 billion, up 196% year-on-year, flat\nsequentially, even as multiple deals slip over into Q1. In VMware, we\nbooked $21 million total CPU costs in the quarter versus $19 million a\nquarter ago. Of these, about 70% represent the VMware Cloud Foundation of\nthis year, the full software stack virtualizing the entire data center. And\nthis translated into annualized booking value, or ABV as we call it, of\n$2.7 billion for VMware in Q4, up from $2.5 billion in Q3.\n\nSince closing the acquisition just over a year ago, we've signed up over\n4,500 of our largest 10,000 customers for VCF. VCF enable customers to\ndeploy private cloud environments on-prem as an alternative to running the\napplications in the public cloud. And in doing all this, we continue to\ndrive down spending in VMware. We brought spending down to $1.2 billion in\nQ4, down from $1.3 billion in Q3. By reference, VMware spending was\naveraging over $2.4 billion per quarter prior to the acquisition with\noperating margin less than 30%.\n\nMoving on to Q1 outlook for infrastructure software. We expect Q1 revenue\nto grow to $6.5 billion, up 11% sequentially and 41% up year-on-year. For\nVMware, ABV is expected to exceed $3 billion compared to $2.7 billion in\nthe preceding quarter.\n\nTurning to semiconductors. Let me give you more details by end markets.\nNetworking. Q4 revenue of $4.5 billion grew 45% year-on-year. AI networking\nrevenue, which represented 76% of networking, grew 158% year-on-year. This\nwas driven by a doubling of our AI XPU shipments to our 3 hyperscale\ncustomers and 4x growth in AI connectivity revenue, driven by our Tomahawk\nand Jericho shipments globally. In Q1, we expect the momentum in AI\nconnectivity to be as strong as more hyperscalers deploy Jericho3-AI in\ntheir fabrics.\n\nOur next-generation XPUs are in 3 nanometers and will be the first of its\nkind into market in that process node. We are on track for volume shipments\nat our hyperscale customers in the second half of fiscal '25.\n\nTurning on to server storage. From its bottom 6 months ago, Q4 server\nstorage connectivity revenue has recovered some 20% to $992 million. And in\nQ4, we expect server storage revenue to continue to grow.\n\nTurning to wireless. As we expected, seasonal launch by our North American\ncustomer drove Q4 wireless revenue to $2.2 billion, up 30% sequentially.\nThis was up 7% year-on-year because of higher content. We continue to be\nvery engaged with this customer in multiyear road maps across various\ntechnologies we have leadership in, including RF, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, sensing\nand touch.\n\nIn Q1, reflecting seasonality, we expect wireless to be down sequentially,\nbut still be flat year-on-year. In Q4, broadband reached bottom at $465\nmillion, down 51% year-on-year. We have seen significant orders across\nmultiple service providers during this quarter. And reflecting this trend,\nwe now expect broadband to show recovery beginning in Q1.\n\nFinally, on to industrial, which only represents 1% of the total revenues.\nMeasured on resales, Q4 industrial resales of $173 million declined 27%\nyear-on-year. We only expect a recovery in the second half 2025.\n\nBefore I sum up and provide you Q1 fiscal '25 guidance, let me outline a\nlonger-term perspective on how we see our semiconductor business evolving\nover the next 3 years. On the broad portfolio of non-AI semiconductors with\nits multiple end markets, we saw a cyclical bottom in fiscal '24 at $17.8\nbillion. We expect a recovery from this level and the industry's historical\ngrowth rate of mid-single digits.\n\nIn sharp contrast, we see our opportunity over the next 3 years in AI as\nmassive. Specific hyperscalers have begun their respective journeys to\ndevelop their own custom AI accelerators or XPUs as well as network these\nXPUs with open and scalable Ethernet connectivity. For each of them, this\nrepresents a multiyear, not a quarter-to-quarter journey.\n\nAs you know, we currently have 3 hyperscale customers, who have developed\ntheir own multi-generational AI XPU road map to be deployed at varying\nrates over the next 3 years. In 2027, we believe each of them plans to\ndeploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. We expect this to\nrepresent an AI revenue serviceable addressable market, or SAM, for XPUs\nand network in the range of $60 billion to $90 billion in fiscal 2027\nalone. We are very well positioned to achieve a leading market share in\nthis opportunity and expect this will drive a strong ramp from our 2024 AI\nrevenue base of $12.2 billion. Keep in mind though, this will not be a\nlinear ramp. We'll show quarterly variability.\n\nTo compound this, we have been selected by 2 additional hyperscalers and\nare in advanced development for their own next-generation AI XPUs. We have\nline of sight to develop these prospects into revenue-generating customers\nbefore 2027 and could, therefore, expand this SAM significantly.\n\nSo the reality going forward for this company is that the AI semiconductor\nbusiness will rapidly outgrow the non-AI semiconductor business.\nRecognizing this, we will now shift to guiding our semiconductor business\nby AI and non-AI revenue segments.\n\nSo summarizing Q4. Semiconductor revenue of $8.2 billion grew 12% year-on-\nyear and 13% sequentially. Q4 AI revenue grew a strong 150% year-on-year to\n$3.7 billion. Non-AI semiconductor revenue declined by 23% year-on-year to\n$4.5 billion, but still a 10% recovery from the bottom of 6 months ago.\n\nNow moving on to our outlook for Q1. We expect semiconductor revenue to\ngrow approximately 10% year-on-year to $8.1 billion. AI demand remains\nstrong and we expect AI revenue to grow 65% year-on-year to $3.8 billion.\nWe expect non-AI semiconductor revenue to be down about mid-teens percent\nyear-on-year. And so in total, summing this all up, we're guiding\nconsolidated Q1 revenue to be approximately $14.6 billion, up 22% year-on-\nyear. And we expect this will drive Q1 adjusted EBITDA to approximately 66%\nof revenue.\n\nWith that, let me turn this call over to Kirsten.\n\nKirsten M. Spears\nCFO & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our Q4 financial\nperformance. Consolidated revenue was $14.1 billion for the quarter, up 51%\nfrom a year ago. Excluding the contribution from VMware, Q4 revenue\nincreased 11% year-on-year. Gross margins were 76.9% of revenue in the\nquarter, up 260 basis points from the year ago quarter. R&D was $1.4\nbillion, and consolidated operating expenses were $2 billion, up year-on-\nyear primarily due to the acquisition and consolidation of VMware.\n\nQ4 operating income was $8.8 billion and was up 53% from a year ago, with\noperating margin at 63% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $9.1 billion or 65%\nof revenue. This figure excludes $156 million of depreciation.\n\nNow a review of the P&L for our 2 segments, starting with semiconductors.\nRevenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $8.2 billion and\nrepresented 59% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 12% year-on-\nyear. Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were\napproximately 67%, down 220 basis points year-on-year, driven primarily by\na higher mix of AI XPUs. Operating expenses increased 11% year-on-year to\n$914 million on increased investment in R&D, resulting in semiconductor\noperating margins of 56%.\n\nNow moving on to infrastructure software. Revenue for infrastructure\nsoftware was $5.8 billion, up 196% year-on-year primarily due to the\ncontribution of VMware and represented 41% of revenue. Gross margins for\ninfrastructure software were 91% in the quarter. And operating expenses\nwere $1.1 billion in the quarter, resulting in infrastructure software\noperating margin of 72%. Excluding transition costs, operating margin was\n73%.\n\nMoving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $5.5 billion and\nrepresented 39% of revenues. Excluding cash used for restructuring and\nintegration of $506 million, free cash flows of $6 billion were up 22% year-\non-year and represented 43% of revenue. Free cash flow as a percentage of\nrevenue has declined from the same quarter a year ago due to higher cash\ninterest expense from debt related to the VMware acquisition, higher cash\ntaxes due to a higher mix of U.S. taxable income, the continued delay in\nthe reenactment of Section 174, and recent proposed regulations on\ncorporate AMT. We spent $122 million on capital expenditures.\n\nDays sales outstanding were 29 days in the fourth quarter compared to 31\ndays a year ago. We ended the fourth quarter with inventory of $1.8\nbillion, down 7% sequentially. We continue to remain disciplined on how we\nmanage inventory across the ecosystem. We ended the fourth quarter with\n$9.3 billion of cash and $69.8 billion of gross principal debt. During the\nquarter, we replaced $5 billion of floating rate debt with new senior\nnotes. We used cash on hand to pay a mix of senior notes, which came due in\nQ4, and additional floating rate debt, reducing debt by $2.5 billion.\n\nFollowing these actions, the weighted average coupon rate and years to\nmaturity of our $56 billion in fixed rate debt is 3.7% and 7.6 years,\nrespectively. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our\n$14 billion in floating rate debt is 5.9% and 3.2 years, respectively. We\nexpect to repay approximately $495 million of fixed rate senior notes\ncoming due in Q1.\n\nNow let me recap our financial performance for fiscal year 2024. Our\nrevenue hit a record $51.6 billion, growing 44% year-on-year, including\nVMware, and 9% organically, excluding VMware. Semiconductor revenue was\n$30.1 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Infrastructure software revenue was\n$21.5 billion, up 181% year-on-year and up 19% year-on-year, excluding\nVMware.\n\nFiscal 2024 adjusted EBITDA was $31.9 billion and represented 62% of\nrevenue. Free cash flow grew 10% year-on-year to $19.4 billion and up 22%\nyear-on-year to $21.9 billion, excluding restructuring and integration\ncosts.\n\nTurning to capital allocation. For fiscal 2024, we spent $22.2 billion,\nconsisting of $9.8 billion in the form of cash dividends and $12.4 billion\nin share repurchases and eliminations. Aligned with our ability to generate\nincreased cash flows in the preceding year and off of a larger share count\nbase from the acquisition of VMware, we are announcing an increase in our\nquarterly common stock cash dividend in Q1 fiscal 2025 to $0.59 per share\non a split-adjusted basis, an increase of 11% from the prior quarter. We\nintend to maintain this target quarterly dividend throughout fiscal '25,\nsubject to quarterly board approval.\n\nThis implies that our fiscal 2025 annual common stock dividend to be a\nrecord $2.36 per share on a split-adjusted basis, an increase of 12% year-\non-year. I would like to highlight that this represents the 14th\nconsecutive increase in annual dividends since we initiated dividends in\nfiscal 2011.\n\nNow moving on to guidance. From a year-on-year comparable basis, keep in\nmind that Q1 of fiscal '24 was a 14-week quarter and Q1 of fiscal '25 is a\n13-week quarter. As we are now past 1 year following the close of the\nVMware acquisition, starting in Q1 of fiscal 2025, we will no longer break\nout VMware revenue and costs on a stand-alone basis. We will continue to\nreport infrastructure software segment revenue and profitability, which\nincludes Brocade Fibre Channel SAN, CA mainframe, enterprise security, and\nVMware.\n\nOur guidance for Q1 is for consolidated revenue of $14.6 billion, with\nsemiconductor revenue of $8.1 billion, up approximately 10% year-on-year,\nand infrastructure software revenue of $6.5 billion, up 41% year-on-year.\nWe expect Q1 adjusted EBITDA to be a record 66% and Q1 non-GAAP diluted\nshare count to be approximately 4.9 billion shares.\n\nFor modeling purposes, we expect Q1 consolidated gross margins to be up 100\nbasis points sequentially on the higher revenue mix of infrastructure\nsoftware and product mix within semiconductors. Note that consolidated\ngross margins through the year will be impacted by the revenue mix of\ninfrastructure software and semiconductors and product mix within\nsemiconductors. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate in fiscal year 2025 to be\napproximately 14.5% as tax deductions related to interest expense are\nreduced as we pay down and refinance debt under more favorable interest\nterms. GAAP net income and cash flows in Q1 will be impacted by higher\ntaxes, restructuring and integration-related cash costs due to the VMware\nacquisition.\nThat concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for\nquestions.\n\nQuestion and Answer\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from the line of\nBlayne Curtis with Jefferies.\n\nBlayne Peter Curtis\nJefferies LLC, Research Division\n\nIt's kind of a clarification and a question. I thought I heard you say that\nAI networking revenue was 76% of networking. I just couldn't get that math\nright, but maybe the broader question is you've seen growth off that low\npoint in April in AI. Can you just talk about ASIC strength versus\nnetworking, the trends you're seeing in kind of October into January?\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nWell, that's a very interesting question. Both were growing, not at the\nsame rate, but we've been shipping, I believe, a lot more of network AI\nconnectivity, networking components in the back half of this year, compared\nto the first half of this fiscal year. And we suspect a lot of that will\ncontinue in the first half of next fiscal year before more XPUs next year.\nAs I indicated, more of the new generation of 3-nanometer XPUs will start\nramping very much in the back half of '25.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of C.J.\nMuse with Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\nChristopher James Muse\nCantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division\n\nI guess, Hock, I wanted to hit on the $60 billion to $90 billion revenue\nrange for fiscal '27 for AI. I was hoping you could speak to the mix you\nsee there between XPU and networking. And within that construct, are you\nincluding all kind of the customers that you see out there in hyperscale\nand vertically integrated consumers? Or any sort of help in terms of what\nyou're including in that potential mix would be very helpful.\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nThank you. Well, thanks for the question. Give me an opportunity here to\nclarify and be very specific. First, on the total dollars, this not\nrevenue, by the way. It's the revenue opportunity for us. It's what I call\na serviceable addressable market, as we all term SAM. Not TAM, SAM. And\nit's serviceable addressable market for 3 of our hyperscale customers.\nThat's it.\n\nIt's a very narrow serviceable addressable market we're talking about. And\nwe're talking about XPUs and AI connectivity. At that scale, AI\nconnectivity could probably estimate to run approximately close to 15% to\n20% of the dollar content.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Joe\nMoore with Morgan Stanley.\n\nJoseph Lawrence Moore\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\n\nI wonder if you could talk to the XPU market. How are your customers sort\nof reacting to some of the rack scale products from your -- the merchant\ncompetitor from NVIDIA? How do they sort of get the connectivity to\nmultiple XPUs inside the rack? Just how does that present a competitive\ndynamic for you?\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nWell, everybody is trying to figure out when you start -- when you connect\na cluster on a single fabric of 10,000 XPUs or GPUs, say GPU, and scale it\nup to 100,000 and on to 500,000 and 1 million, it's a whole new game in\nterms of architecture.\n\nAnd so you guys hear the differences of when you do these racks, you have\nwhat you call scale out. And then you have joining rack to rack because you\nhave no choice. You can't get to 1 million or for that matter 100,000\notherwise. You call it scale out. And that's a continuing evolving\narchitecture. But I think each of these hyperscale customers of ours have,\nat this point, kind of figured out how to get there. Hence, a road map that\nwill keep growing from 100,000 to 1 million XPU cluster on pretty much\nsimilar architecture basis over the next 3, 4 years.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of\nHarlan Sur with JPMorgan.\n\nHarlan L. Sur\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nHock, I know the team has been putting out an AI guide for fiscal '25. And\nI appreciate the multiyear sort of SAM opportunity outlook. But for this\nyear, can we look at what your customers on the networking and custom\naccelerators are thinking about from a data center CapEx spending\nperspective?\n\nSo for example, our latest roll up is that the top 4 cloud and hyperscalers\nare going to grow their CapEx 35%, 40% in fiscal '25. I would expect that\nyour AI business would sort of closely mirror this trend, maybe even think\nabout it as a base case when we think about Ethernet taking share from\nInfiniBand, ASICs growing faster than merchant GPUs. Maybe the profile of\nyour AI business can go even faster than the CapEx trend. Either way, plus\nor minus, is that how we should think about the growth in the AI business?\nRoughly in line with CapEx growth trends of your large cloud and hyperscale\ncustomers?\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nHarlan, no, it doesn't. I mean I think the hyperscalers tend to give you an\noverall CapEx numbers. I'm not sure they really break out between what's AI\nand what's non-AI out there. And clearly, the spend in AI outstrips the\nspend in non-AI even on the CapEx. And so no, I won't necessarily stop at\nthat.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Stacy\nRasgon with Bernstein.\n\nStacy Aaron Rasgon\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\n\nI have a more tactical question. So you have software pushouts into Q1,\nwhich is elevating it. Should we think about that -- those pushouts start\nrolling off as we get into Q2 and the back half of the year? And like what\nare the implications on the shape of software for the year as well as gross\nmargins?\n\nBecause I guess maybe in the back half, you'll have like software a little\nweaker versus Q2 as well as the XPU stronger. So should we be thinking\nabout the gross margin trajectory of the current elevated base kind of like\neasing as we get in the back half? So just anything you can tell us around\nthe shape of the software around the pushouts and implications for revenues\nand gross margins.\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nWell, number one, it's a slip. And I think you're overthinking this whole\nproject. It's just a slip, pick it up, and you see the differences between\nQ4 growth and Q1 re-acceleration. That's all it is. One...\n\nStacy Aaron Rasgon\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\n\nI'm asking, should Q2 be lower because you had pushout into Q1 is what I'm\nasking.\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nNo, it doesn't. Not Q2, no. I don't -- it won't have a material impact on\nthe rest of the fiscal '25.\n\nStacy Aaron Rasgon\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\n\nDo you think software can kind of hold at these levels or even grow off of\nthese like $6.5 billion levels as we go through the year?\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nI'm not giving you guidance. I might remind you for the rest of the year.\nI'm just giving you guidance for Q1, but I'm just telling you your analysis\nis kind of defective.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd one moment for our next question. And that will come from Benjamin\nReitzes with Melius.\n\nBenjamin Alexander Reitzes\nMelius Research LLC\n\nNice quarter there, Hock. I wanted to ask you about the $60 billion to $90\nbillion with a little more clarity. Previously, you've talked about a\ncumulative TAM from your customers. So -- and that -- is this a run rate\nTAM or a cumulative TAM? Kind of meaning, do we take the $12.2 billion then\nadd some growth for the next 2 years, and then think of it that way? Or do\nwe think of -- we take a share of like a $75 billion TAM and what your\nrevenue yield is?\n\nAnd then I just also was hoping you could clarify. You're not including\nthose 2 new customers. Do those 2 customers have the same $20 billion to\n$30 billion TAM each that the current 3 do? Or do you think they're smaller\nor bigger? Sorry about the multipart question there.\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nNo. I think you asked -- the first part was very similar to an earlier\nquestion, but I'd be pleased to clarify. No, the $60 billion to $90\nbillion, it's not -- we are not talking cumulative SAM or TAM anymore. We\nare putting for you a destination, so to speak, a milestone, which happens\nto be 3 years hence, 2027, possibly slip a bit part of '28, but 2027. We\nare seeing a destination 2027 or a milestone, the other one, where the\ndeployment of those large-scale AI clusters, each on single fabric pretty\nmuch to run those large LLM models, will come to $60 billion to $90 billion\nin the 1-year period. And collectively, all 3 of them.\n\nAnd to answer the second part too, possibly, yes, at least one of them, we\nbelieve, yes. But you know what, I don't want you adding 1 plus 1 equals 2\nhere. Those are not validated in our view under our model as customers. So\nplease don't do your addition to the $60 billion to $90 billion SAM that I\nhave postulated in my remarks.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Ross\nSeymore with Deutsche Bank.\n\nRoss Clark Seymore\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\n\nI want to talk about the cash return side of things. Great job on the\ndividend increase. The other 50%, is fiscal '25 a year where you're going\nto still be paying down debt? Share repurchases in the mix? Or Hock, you\nmentioned that VMware, the integration is largely now behind you. Usually,\nthat puts you on the prowl looking for deals.\n\nIs that something we should, in general, think about? Or is there\nregulatory issues that are still a concern? Just trying to figure out what\nthat other 50% is going to go towards this year.\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nWell, to start with, yes, the other 50% of cash that is -- will be\ngenerated that we will not use, that is beyond dividends. We only one use\nfor it -- 2 uses for it, we've always said. One is parking on balance sheet\nfor the opportunity to buy someone else. But in reality, we're buying big\nenough companies, you almost say that 50% cash is sitting there is not\nadequate.\n\nSo the likely use of that 50% cash is, as Kirsten indicated in her prepared\nremarks, pay down debt. We do intend to use part of that 50% free cash flow\nthat's not used for dividends to go de-lever ourselves, given the size of\nthe debt load we are taking on or we have taken on since we acquired\nVMware.\n\nKirsten M. Spears\nCFO & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nYes, Ross. It's Kirsten. We want to focus on reducing interest expense, so\nwe'll go after those term loans. So yes, the focus will be on paying down\ndebt.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd one moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Vivek\nArya with Bank of America.\n\nVivek Arya\nBofA Securities, Research Division\n\nHock, back to AI. What do you think is the SAM in 2024, so we can get a\nbaseline view of what your $12.2 billion in sales represent? And is your\nassumption that you maintain the share, right? You grow it? Or what happens\nto that share over time?\n\nAnd then sort of related question to that is what happens to your\nsemiconductor gross margins if AI grows, right, to such an extent? Because\nyou gave us a mid-single digit for non-AI. And I'm wondering, if AI gets to\nbe such a big part of semis, what happens to gross margin? So both kind of\nthe baseline of what the SAM was this year and what happens to your share\nand margins over time?\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nOkay. That's a very insightful question on the first one, which -- on the\nfirst one, anyway, where we are saying what is the baseline on the $60\nbillion to $90 billion in 3 years' time, where we are specifying down to\nthese 3 customers of ours. And I would estimate this 2024 for that to be\nabout less than $20 billion -- $15 billion to $20 billion at this point. In\n2024, $15 billion to $20 billion, going to $60 billion to $90 billion,\nright?\n\nAnd in terms of margins, well, don't get too hung up about gross margin\nplease, Vivek, because you're not wrong. Gross margin in semiconductors\nwill dilute, you're [ correct ] in saying that. But see, the game here is\nthe revenue will leverage so much on the spending we have to do to generate\nit that the operating margin will improve from where we are today.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Harsh\nKumar with Piper Sandler.\n\nHarsh V. Kumar\nPiper Sandler & Co., Research Division\n\nYes. First of all, guys, huge congratulations on successfully integrating\nVMware so much ahead of your time frame. And Hock, I had a 2-part question.\nIs there a simple dollar metric that we can think of for network attach to\nXPUs? For example, is $1 of networking to $1 of XPUs?\n\nAnd then for my question, in one of your posts, you talked about sovereign\ndata centers and VMware. I guess my question is, is there a play for\nBroadcom outside of the software piece? In other words, are you noticing\nthat sovereign guys are wanting to use XPUs? Or are they strictly sticking\nto merchant silicon?\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nLet me answer your question backwards, the easiest one first. Sovereign\nguys are like most of the other -- it's pretty much like enterprise market,\nwhich is simply merchant. Sovereign guys do not have the capability\nnecessarily to create first, the hardware, but more importantly, the\nsoftware stack to enable transistors in the hardware to translate itself\ninto high-level language, which then the LLM, the large language models,\nand AI applications can operate on. So they'll stick to what's available,\nwhich is merchant silicon and the available ecosystem of software layers\nthat allow that translation. So it will be done very much that way on XPUs.\n\nAnd on your first question of what's the ratio between AI connectivity,\nnetworking, that is you're saying, to XPUs, the compute, well, it's a\nchanging number as the cluster expands, though there are some ratios to be\nlooked at. And the simple ratio to look at is there is scale up and there\nis scale out. And as we expand into a single fabric cluster of XPUs or GPUs\nthat grows bigger and bigger, guess what is more important? Scale up\nbecomes more important. And the ratio we are talking about as we move up\nincreases almost exponentially, which is why I'm saying from probably\nnetworking as a percent of AI content in silicon today of between 5% to\n10%, you're going up to 15% to 20% by the time you hit 500,000 to 1 million\nXPU GPU clusters.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of\nToshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\n\nToshiya Hari\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\n\nThe $60 billion to $90 billion SAM forecast for fiscal '27, Hock, I'm\ncurious if you guys have a view on the TAM. So just want to know how big\nthe SAM is as a percentage of the total opportunity set.\n\nAnd then my main question is you talked about going for leading market\nshare within your SAM, which makes sense. I assume you're not assuming 100%\nshare. So the value of that $60 billion to $90 billion that you won't be\ncapturing, is that a function of some of your hyperscale customers wanting\nto capture value internally? Or is that always having a backup or a second\nsource? Is there a low-margin business that you just simply won't pursue?\nHow should we think about the part of the $60 billion to $90 billion that\nyou won't be going after or won't be capturing?\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nOkay. First, to answer the bigger overarching question, I don't know the\nTAM. I don't make any parts of the 2 -- I don't think too far and hard\nabout them. We don't think in macro approaches. We're looking at line of\nsight here. So I got customers, I try to figure out how much volume the --\nwhere the road map of the customer is, not just product, technology, but\nwhat they are building out, what is their consumption pattern like. That's\nhow we create our SAM. Actually, in a way, bottoms up, then top down. So I\nhave no idea what the TAM is beyond customers we are serving closely,\ncollaborating closely. So let's make it clear.\n\nIn terms of market share, I don't know. But as you all can see, it's a very\nlarge, substantial market opportunity. There's room for many players. All\nwe're going to do is gain our fair share. We're just very well positioned\ntoday having the best technology, very relevant in this space. We have, by\nfar, one of the best technology -- combination technology out there to do\nXPUs and to connect those XPUs.\n\nThe silicon technology that enables it, we have it here in Broadcom by the\nboatloads, which is why we are very well positioned with these 3 customers\nof ours. So we -- based on that, we are -- and based on the depth of our\nengagement today, this didn't just start. This has been going on now for a\nwhile in terms of deep engagement with engineering teams from the other\nside -- each of the other side. We are very well positioned, well underway\nto creating a multiyear road map for -- to enable these few customers of\nours to get to where their ambition leads them to be in. And it's because\nof the great technology we have, where we are actually enabling in the\nareas we're very good at. We're talking about silicon design, packaging\ndesign and optical technology.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of\nWilliam Stein with Truist Securities.\n\nWilliam Stein\nTruist Securities, Inc., Research Division\n\nI want to add my congrats to all the great results this year and for the\nquarter and outlook. But Hock, this is sort of a stunning turn of events in\nthe last year with what we've been accustomed to thinking of as a sort of\nmature, slow growth business at its core, with all the M&A tacked on to it.\nAnd I wonder, with the sudden acceleration of the organic business given\nyour exposure to these capabilities in ASICs to bring AI technologies to\ncustomers, does that change your interest level in M&A? And does it change\nyour focus area of potential M&A going forward?\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nNo, it doesn't. We are open, still open, always open because that's been a\ncore part of our strategy and business model of this company for the last\n10 years, which is we're always interested in adding to our portfolio very\ngood franchise assets, be they in semiconductors or be they in\ninfrastructure software. As long as, as we always say, they meet the\ncriteria, the fairly demanding criteria we look for, we would always be\nopen to acquiring these assets and adding into our portfolio. So no, it\nhasn't changed our thinking at all.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Vijay\nRakesh with Mizuho.\n\nVijay Raghavan Rakesh\nMizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division\n\nHock, great results here. Just a question back on the AI custom silicon\nside. I guess it looks like of the $17.5 billion TAM here -- or SAM here,\nyou have about 70% share. So assuming that 70% looking out to '27, your\ncustom silicon AI revenues should be like $50 billion in fiscal '27. So are\nwe -- do we have a good line of sight into fiscal '26, showing a pretty\nnice ramp to hit those numbers, maybe with Ultra Ethernet and all that to\ndo the 1 million XPUs? How do you see that?\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nI don't know. We don't have really a good enough line of sight to want to\nshare it with you nor, for that matter, do we have a policy of giving you\nguidance beyond what we're doing, 1 quarter a year. But we do want to give\nyou a sense of where this journey is headed. We want to give you a sense of\nwhere this could lead us, this company, in terms of its AI -- semiconductor\nAI revenue trajectory.\n\nGiven that we now made it very open, official almost, that we are going\nforward only are guiding AI revenue versus non-AI revenue, we figured at\nleast give you a sense of what the AI trajectory is. On the non-AI, we have\nknown it. You have known it with us for a long time. It's mature, it's\nstable, evolving, growing mid-single-digit GDP plus.\n\nAI, we've never given you that. So that's why we take this step now,\nunprecedented in some ways, of laying that road map in terms of potential\nmarket for AI.\n\nNow only market we have is the customers we have and the end markets we\nserve. So we create this SAM and we -- the clarity we see is, to some\nextent, in 2027. How that journey progresses with each of our customers is\nsomewhat variable. It's the rate of the adoption and how -- of their own\nXPUs, and we'll be very much a part of their journey. But because of that,\nwe expect to see a situation where there could be quarter-to-quarter\nvariability, given there are only 3 customers and the fact that deployment\ncomes in big chunks, typically. So my best answer to you is I can't give\nyou any clarity beyond what I've given so far.\n\nVijay Raghavan Rakesh\nMizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division\n\nGot it. And the other 2 CSPs, when do you see them ramping?\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nWell, first of all, I got to get into production. They got to get into\nproduction. So why don't we cross that bridge when we get to it? We are\nworking very hard with them to get it production stage. We're pretty deeply\nengaged. We have tape-out chips. And -- but they got to get their software\nready, they got to get it tested, and they got to get going on it. So now,\nI'm not sure. But definitely, over the next 3 years.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd thank you. That is all the time we have for our question-and-answer\nsession. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ji Yoo, Head of\nInvestor Relations, for closing remarks.\n\nJi Yoo\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Sherry.

  "presentation_text": "Operator\n\nWelcome to the Broadcom Inc.'s Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2024\nFinancial Results Conference Call. At this time, for opening remarks and\nintroductions, I would like to turn the call over Ji Yoo, Head of Investor\nRelations of Broadcom Inc.\n\nJi Yoo\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today's call\nare Hock Tan, President and CEO; Kirsten Spears, Chief Financial Officer;\nand Charlie Kawwas, President, Semiconductor Solutions Group.\n\nBroadcom distributed a press release and financial tables after the market\nclosed, describing our financial performance for the fourth quarter and\nfiscal year 2024. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the\ninformation from the Investors section of Broadcom's website at\nbroadcom.com.\n\nThis conference call is being webcast live and an audio replay of the\nconference call can be accessed for 1 year through the Investors section of\nBroadcom's website. During the prepared comments, Hock and Kirsten will be\nproviding details of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 results,\nguidance for our first quarter of fiscal year 2025 as well as commentary\nregarding the business environment.\n\nWe'll take questions after the end of our prepared comments. Please refer\nto our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for\ninformation on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual\nresults to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on\nthis call.\n\nIn addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial\nmeasures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP\nmeasures is included in the tables attached to today's press release.\nComments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP\nfinancial results.\n\nI will now turn the call over to Hock.\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nThank you, Ji, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Well, this\nhas been a transformative year for Broadcom. Our fiscal year 2024\nconsolidated revenue grew 44% year-over-year to a record $51.6 billion. Now\nexcluding VMware, our revenue grew over 9% organically. So fiscal '24\noperating profit, excluding transition costs, grew 42% year-over-year, and\nwe returned a record $22 billion in cash to our shareholders, up 45% year-\non-year through dividends, buybacks and eliminations.\n\nThere were 2 significant drivers of this transformation this year. First,\nwe closed the acquisition of VMware in the early weeks of fiscal '24 and\nhave focused VMware on its technology leadership in data center\nvirtualization. The integration of VMware is largely complete. Revenue is\non a growth trajectory, and operating margin reached 70% exiting 2024.\n\nWe are well on the path to delivering incremental adjusted EBITDA at a\nlevel that significantly exceeds the $8.5 billion we communicated when we\nannounced the deal. We're planning to achieve this much earlier than our\ninitial target of 3 years.\n\nThe second driver in 2024 was AI. Our AI revenue, which came from strength\nin custom AI accelerators, or XPUs, and networking grew 220% from $3.8\nbillion in fiscal '23 to $12.2 billion in fiscal '24 and represented 41% of\nour semiconductor revenue. This drove semiconductor revenue up to a record\n$30.1 billion during the year.\n\nOkay. Now let's move on to the fourth quarter and give you more color.\nConsolidated net revenue of $14.1 billion was up 51% year-on-year.\nExcluding VMware, organic growth was 11%. And operating profit of $8.8\nbillion was up 53% year-on-year.\n\nFor the details on infrastructure software in Q4, this infrastructure\nsoftware segment revenue was $5.8 billion, up 196% year-on-year, flat\nsequentially, even as multiple deals slip over into Q1. In VMware, we\nbooked $21 million total CPU costs in the quarter versus $19 million a\nquarter ago. Of these, about 70% represent the VMware Cloud Foundation of\nthis year, the full software stack virtualizing the entire data center. And\nthis translated into annualized booking value, or ABV as we call it, of\n$2.7 billion for VMware in Q4, up from $2.5 billion in Q3.\n\nSince closing the acquisition just over a year ago, we've signed up over\n4,500 of our largest 10,000 customers for VCF. VCF enable customers to\ndeploy private cloud environments on-prem as an alternative to running the\napplications in the public cloud. And in doing all this, we continue to\ndrive down spending in VMware. We brought spending down to $1.2 billion in\nQ4, down from $1.3 billion in Q3. By reference, VMware spending was\naveraging over $2.4 billion per quarter prior to the acquisition with\noperating margin less than 30%.\n\nMoving on to Q1 outlook for infrastructure software. We expect Q1 revenue\nto grow to $6.5 billion, up 11% sequentially and 41% up year-on-year. For\nVMware, ABV is expected to exceed $3 billion compared to $2.7 billion in\nthe preceding quarter.\n\nTurning to semiconductors. Let me give you more details by end markets.\nNetworking. Q4 revenue of $4.5 billion grew 45% year-on-year. AI networking\nrevenue, which represented 76% of networking, grew 158% year-on-year. This\nwas driven by a doubling of our AI XPU shipments to our 3 hyperscale\ncustomers and 4x growth in AI connectivity revenue, driven by our Tomahawk\nand Jericho shipments globally. In Q1, we expect the momentum in AI\nconnectivity to be as strong as more hyperscalers deploy Jericho3-AI in\ntheir fabrics.\n\nOur next-generation XPUs are in 3 nanometers and will be the first of its\nkind into market in that process node. We are on track for volume shipments\nat our hyperscale customers in the second half of fiscal '25.\n\nTurning on to server storage. From its bottom 6 months ago, Q4 server\nstorage connectivity revenue has recovered some 20% to $992 million. And in\nQ4, we expect server storage revenue to continue to grow.\n\nTurning to wireless. As we expected, seasonal launch by our North American\ncustomer drove Q4 wireless revenue to $2.2 billion, up 30% sequentially.\nThis was up 7% year-on-year because of higher content. We continue to be\nvery engaged with this customer in multiyear road maps across various\ntechnologies we have leadership in, including RF, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, sensing\nand touch.\n\nIn Q1, reflecting seasonality, we expect wireless to be down sequentially,\nbut still be flat year-on-year. In Q4, broadband reached bottom at $465\nmillion, down 51% year-on-year. We have seen significant orders across\nmultiple service providers during this quarter. And reflecting this trend,\nwe now expect broadband to show recovery beginning in Q1.\n\nFinally, on to industrial, which only represents 1% of the total revenues.\nMeasured on resales, Q4 industrial resales of $173 million declined 27%\nyear-on-year. We only expect a recovery in the second half 2025.\n\nBefore I sum up and provide you Q1 fiscal '25 guidance, let me outline a\nlonger-term perspective on how we see our semiconductor business evolving\nover the next 3 years. On the broad portfolio of non-AI semiconductors with\nits multiple end markets, we saw a cyclical bottom in fiscal '24 at $17.8\nbillion. We expect a recovery from this level and the industry's historical\ngrowth rate of mid-single digits.\n\nIn sharp contrast, we see our opportunity over the next 3 years in AI as\nmassive. Specific hyperscalers have begun their respective journeys to\ndevelop their own custom AI accelerators or XPUs as well as network these\nXPUs with open and scalable Ethernet connectivity. For each of them, this\nrepresents a multiyear, not a quarter-to-quarter journey.\n\nAs you know, we currently have 3 hyperscale customers, who have developed\ntheir own multi-generational AI XPU road map to be deployed at varying\nrates over the next 3 years. In 2027, we believe each of them plans to\ndeploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. We expect this to\nrepresent an AI revenue serviceable addressable market, or SAM, for XPUs\nand network in the range of $60 billion to $90 billion in fiscal 2027\nalone. We are very well positioned to achieve a leading market share in\nthis opportunity and expect this will drive a strong ramp from our 2024 AI\nrevenue base of $12.2 billion. Keep in mind though, this will not be a\nlinear ramp. We'll show quarterly variability.\n\nTo compound this, we have been selected by 2 additional hyperscalers and\nare in advanced development for their own next-generation AI XPUs. We have\nline of sight to develop these prospects into revenue-generating customers\nbefore 2027 and could, therefore, expand this SAM significantly.\n\nSo the reality going forward for this company is that the AI semiconductor\nbusiness will rapidly outgrow the non-AI semiconductor business.\nRecognizing this, we will now shift to guiding our semiconductor business\nby AI and non-AI revenue segments.\n\nSo summarizing Q4. Semiconductor revenue of $8.2 billion grew 12% year-on-\nyear and 13% sequentially. Q4 AI revenue grew a strong 150% year-on-year to\n$3.7 billion. Non-AI semiconductor revenue declined by 23% year-on-year to\n$4.5 billion, but still a 10% recovery from the bottom of 6 months ago.\n\nNow moving on to our outlook for Q1. We expect semiconductor revenue to\ngrow approximately 10% year-on-year to $8.1 billion. AI demand remains\nstrong and we expect AI revenue to grow 65% year-on-year to $3.8 billion.\nWe expect non-AI semiconductor revenue to be down about mid-teens percent\nyear-on-year. And so in total, summing this all up, we're guiding\nconsolidated Q1 revenue to be approximately $14.6 billion, up 22% year-on-\nyear. And we expect this will drive Q1 adjusted EBITDA to approximately 66%\nof revenue.\n\nWith that, let me turn this call over to Kirsten.\n\nKirsten M. Spears\nCFO & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our Q4 financial\nperformance. Consolidated revenue was $14.1 billion for the quarter, up 51%\nfrom a year ago. Excluding the contribution from VMware, Q4 revenue\nincreased 11% year-on-year. Gross margins were 76.9% of revenue in the\nquarter, up 260 basis points from the year ago quarter. R&D was $1.4\nbillion, and consolidated operating expenses were $2 billion, up year-on-\nyear primarily due to the acquisition and consolidation of VMware.\n\nQ4 operating income was $8.8 billion and was up 53% from a year ago, with\noperating margin at 63% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $9.1 billion or 65%\nof revenue. This figure excludes $156 million of depreciation.\n\nNow a review of the P&L for our 2 segments, starting with semiconductors.\nRevenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $8.2 billion and\nrepresented 59% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 12% year-on-\nyear. Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were\napproximately 67%, down 220 basis points year-on-year, driven primarily by\na higher mix of AI XPUs. Operating expenses increased 11% year-on-year to\n$914 million on increased investment in R&D, resulting in semiconductor\noperating margins of 56%.\n\nNow moving on to infrastructure software. Revenue for infrastructure\nsoftware was $5.8 billion, up 196% year-on-year primarily due to the\ncontribution of VMware and represented 41% of revenue. Gross margins for\ninfrastructure software were 91% in the quarter. And operating expenses\nwere $1.1 billion in the quarter, resulting in infrastructure software\noperating margin of 72%. Excluding transition costs, operating margin was\n73%.\n\nMoving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $5.5 billion and\nrepresented 39% of revenues. Excluding cash used for restructuring and\nintegration of $506 million, free cash flows of $6 billion were up 22% year-\non-year and represented 43% of revenue. Free cash flow as a percentage of\nrevenue has declined from the same quarter a year ago due to higher cash\ninterest expense from debt related to the VMware acquisition, higher cash\ntaxes due to a higher mix of U.S. taxable income, the continued delay in\nthe reenactment of Section 174, and recent proposed regulations on\ncorporate AMT. We spent $122 million on capital expenditures.\n\nDays sales outstanding were 29 days in the fourth quarter compared to 31\ndays a year ago. We ended the fourth quarter with inventory of $1.8\nbillion, down 7% sequentially. We continue to remain disciplined on how we\nmanage inventory across the ecosystem. We ended the fourth quarter with\n$9.3 billion of cash and $69.8 billion of gross principal debt. During the\nquarter, we replaced $5 billion of floating rate debt with new senior\nnotes. We used cash on hand to pay a mix of senior notes, which came due in\nQ4, and additional floating rate debt, reducing debt by $2.5 billion.\n\nFollowing these actions, the weighted average coupon rate and years to\nmaturity of our $56 billion in fixed rate debt is 3.7% and 7.6 years,\nrespectively. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our\n$14 billion in floating rate debt is 5.9% and 3.2 years, respectively. We\nexpect to repay approximately $495 million of fixed rate senior notes\ncoming due in Q1.\n\nNow let me recap our financial performance for fiscal year 2024. Our\nrevenue hit a record $51.6 billion, growing 44% year-on-year, including\nVMware, and 9% organically, excluding VMware. Semiconductor revenue was\n$30.1 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Infrastructure software revenue was\n$21.5 billion, up 181% year-on-year and up 19% year-on-year, excluding\nVMware.\n\nFiscal 2024 adjusted EBITDA was $31.9 billion and represented 62% of\nrevenue. Free cash flow grew 10% year-on-year to $19.4 billion and up 22%\nyear-on-year to $21.9 billion, excluding restructuring and integration\ncosts.\n\nTurning to capital allocation. For fiscal 2024, we spent $22.2 billion,\nconsisting of $9.8 billion in the form of cash dividends and $12.4 billion\nin share repurchases and eliminations. Aligned with our ability to generate\nincreased cash flows in the preceding year and off of a larger share count\nbase from the acquisition of VMware, we are announcing an increase in our\nquarterly common stock cash dividend in Q1 fiscal 2025 to $0.59 per share\non a split-adjusted basis, an increase of 11% from the prior quarter. We\nintend to maintain this target quarterly dividend throughout fiscal '25,\nsubject to quarterly board approval.\n\nThis implies that our fiscal 2025 annual common stock dividend to be a\nrecord $2.36 per share on a split-adjusted basis, an increase of 12% year-\non-year. I would like to highlight that this represents the 14th\nconsecutive increase in annual dividends since we initiated dividends in\nfiscal 2011.\n\nNow moving on to guidance. From a year-on-year comparable basis, keep in\nmind that Q1 of fiscal '24 was a 14-week quarter and Q1 of fiscal '25 is a\n13-week quarter. As we are now past 1 year following the close of the\nVMware acquisition, starting in Q1 of fiscal 2025, we will no longer break\nout VMware revenue and costs on a stand-alone basis. We will continue to\nreport infrastructure software segment revenue and profitability, which\nincludes Brocade Fibre Channel SAN, CA mainframe, enterprise security, and\nVMware.\n\nOur guidance for Q1 is for consolidated revenue of $14.6 billion, with\nsemiconductor revenue of $8.1 billion, up approximately 10% year-on-year,\nand infrastructure software revenue of $6.5 billion, up 41% year-on-year.\nWe expect Q1 adjusted EBITDA to be a record 66% and Q1 non-GAAP diluted\nshare count to be approximately 4.9 billion shares.\n\nFor modeling purposes, we expect Q1 consolidated gross margins to be up 100\nbasis points sequentially on the higher revenue mix of infrastructure\nsoftware and product mix within semiconductors. Note that consolidated\ngross margins through the year will be impacted by the revenue mix of\ninfrastructure software and semiconductors and product mix within\nsemiconductors. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate in fiscal year 2025 to be\napproximately 14.5% as tax deductions related to interest expense are\nreduced as we pay down and refinance debt under more favorable interest\nterms. GAAP net income and cash flows in Q1 will be impacted by higher\ntaxes, restructuring and integration-related cash costs due to the VMware\nacquisition.\nThat concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for\nquestions.",
  "qa_text": "Operator\n\n[Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from the line of\nBlayne Curtis with Jefferies.\n\nBlayne Peter Curtis\nJefferies LLC, Research Division\n\nIt's kind of a clarification and a question. I thought I heard you say that\nAI networking revenue was 76% of networking. I just couldn't get that math\nright, but maybe the broader question is you've seen growth off that low\npoint in April in AI. Can you just talk about ASIC strength versus\nnetworking, the trends you're seeing in kind of October into January?\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nWell, that's a very interesting question. Both were growing, not at the\nsame rate, but we've been shipping, I believe, a lot more of network AI\nconnectivity, networking components in the back half of this year, compared\nto the first half of this fiscal year. And we suspect a lot of that will\ncontinue in the first half of next fiscal year before more XPUs next year.\nAs I indicated, more of the new generation of 3-nanometer XPUs will start\nramping very much in the back half of '25.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of C.J.\nMuse with Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\nChristopher James Muse\nCantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division\n\nI guess, Hock, I wanted to hit on the $60 billion to $90 billion revenue\nrange for fiscal '27 for AI. I was hoping you could speak to the mix you\nsee there between XPU and networking. And within that construct, are you\nincluding all kind of the customers that you see out there in hyperscale\nand vertically integrated consumers? Or any sort of help in terms of what\nyou're including in that potential mix would be very helpful.\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nThank you. Well, thanks for the question. Give me an opportunity here to\nclarify and be very specific. First, on the total dollars, this not\nrevenue, by the way. It's the revenue opportunity for us. It's what I call\na serviceable addressable market, as we all term SAM. Not TAM, SAM. And\nit's serviceable addressable market for 3 of our hyperscale customers.\nThat's it.\n\nIt's a very narrow serviceable addressable market we're talking about. And\nwe're talking about XPUs and AI connectivity. At that scale, AI\nconnectivity could probably estimate to run approximately close to 15% to\n20% of the dollar content.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Joe\nMoore with Morgan Stanley.\n\nJoseph Lawrence Moore\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\n\nI wonder if you could talk to the XPU market. How are your customers sort\nof reacting to some of the rack scale products from your -- the merchant\ncompetitor from NVIDIA? How do they sort of get the connectivity to\nmultiple XPUs inside the rack? Just how does that present a competitive\ndynamic for you?\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nWell, everybody is trying to figure out when you start -- when you connect\na cluster on a single fabric of 10,000 XPUs or GPUs, say GPU, and scale it\nup to 100,000 and on to 500,000 and 1 million, it's a whole new game in\nterms of architecture.\n\nAnd so you guys hear the differences of when you do these racks, you have\nwhat you call scale out. And then you have joining rack to rack because you\nhave no choice. You can't get to 1 million or for that matter 100,000\notherwise. You call it scale out. And that's a continuing evolving\narchitecture. But I think each of these hyperscale customers of ours have,\nat this point, kind of figured out how to get there. Hence, a road map that\nwill keep growing from 100,000 to 1 million XPU cluster on pretty much\nsimilar architecture basis over the next 3, 4 years.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of\nHarlan Sur with JPMorgan.\n\nHarlan L. Sur\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nHock, I know the team has been putting out an AI guide for fiscal '25. And\nI appreciate the multiyear sort of SAM opportunity outlook. But for this\nyear, can we look at what your customers on the networking and custom\naccelerators are thinking about from a data center CapEx spending\nperspective?\n\nSo for example, our latest roll up is that the top 4 cloud and hyperscalers\nare going to grow their CapEx 35%, 40% in fiscal '25. I would expect that\nyour AI business would sort of closely mirror this trend, maybe even think\nabout it as a base case when we think about Ethernet taking share from\nInfiniBand, ASICs growing faster than merchant GPUs. Maybe the profile of\nyour AI business can go even faster than the CapEx trend. Either way, plus\nor minus, is that how we should think about the growth in the AI business?\nRoughly in line with CapEx growth trends of your large cloud and hyperscale\ncustomers?\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nHarlan, no, it doesn't. I mean I think the hyperscalers tend to give you an\noverall CapEx numbers. I'm not sure they really break out between what's AI\nand what's non-AI out there. And clearly, the spend in AI outstrips the\nspend in non-AI even on the CapEx. And so no, I won't necessarily stop at\nthat.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Stacy\nRasgon with Bernstein.\n\nStacy Aaron Rasgon\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\n\nI have a more tactical question. So you have software pushouts into Q1,\nwhich is elevating it. Should we think about that -- those pushouts start\nrolling off as we get into Q2 and the back half of the year? And like what\nare the implications on the shape of software for the year as well as gross\nmargins?\n\nBecause I guess maybe in the back half, you'll have like software a little\nweaker versus Q2 as well as the XPU stronger. So should we be thinking\nabout the gross margin trajectory of the current elevated base kind of like\neasing as we get in the back half? So just anything you can tell us around\nthe shape of the software around the pushouts and implications for revenues\nand gross margins.\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nWell, number one, it's a slip. And I think you're overthinking this whole\nproject. It's just a slip, pick it up, and you see the differences between\nQ4 growth and Q1 re-acceleration. That's all it is. One...\n\nStacy Aaron Rasgon\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\n\nI'm asking, should Q2 be lower because you had pushout into Q1 is what I'm\nasking.\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nNo, it doesn't. Not Q2, no. I don't -- it won't have a material impact on\nthe rest of the fiscal '25.\n\nStacy Aaron Rasgon\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\n\nDo you think software can kind of hold at these levels or even grow off of\nthese like $6.5 billion levels as we go through the year?\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nI'm not giving you guidance. I might remind you for the rest of the year.\nI'm just giving you guidance for Q1, but I'm just telling you your analysis\nis kind of defective.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd one moment for our next question. And that will come from Benjamin\nReitzes with Melius.\n\nBenjamin Alexander Reitzes\nMelius Research LLC\n\nNice quarter there, Hock. I wanted to ask you about the $60 billion to $90\nbillion with a little more clarity. Previously, you've talked about a\ncumulative TAM from your customers. So -- and that -- is this a run rate\nTAM or a cumulative TAM? Kind of meaning, do we take the $12.2 billion then\nadd some growth for the next 2 years, and then think of it that way? Or do\nwe think of -- we take a share of like a $75 billion TAM and what your\nrevenue yield is?\n\nAnd then I just also was hoping you could clarify. You're not including\nthose 2 new customers. Do those 2 customers have the same $20 billion to\n$30 billion TAM each that the current 3 do? Or do you think they're smaller\nor bigger? Sorry about the multipart question there.\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nNo. I think you asked -- the first part was very similar to an earlier\nquestion, but I'd be pleased to clarify. No, the $60 billion to $90\nbillion, it's not -- we are not talking cumulative SAM or TAM anymore. We\nare putting for you a destination, so to speak, a milestone, which happens\nto be 3 years hence, 2027, possibly slip a bit part of '28, but 2027. We\nare seeing a destination 2027 or a milestone, the other one, where the\ndeployment of those large-scale AI clusters, each on single fabric pretty\nmuch to run those large LLM models, will come to $60 billion to $90 billion\nin the 1-year period. And collectively, all 3 of them.\n\nAnd to answer the second part too, possibly, yes, at least one of them, we\nbelieve, yes. But you know what, I don't want you adding 1 plus 1 equals 2\nhere. Those are not validated in our view under our model as customers. So\nplease don't do your addition to the $60 billion to $90 billion SAM that I\nhave postulated in my remarks.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Ross\nSeymore with Deutsche Bank.\n\nRoss Clark Seymore\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\n\nI want to talk about the cash return side of things. Great job on the\ndividend increase. The other 50%, is fiscal '25 a year where you're going\nto still be paying down debt? Share repurchases in the mix? Or Hock, you\nmentioned that VMware, the integration is largely now behind you. Usually,\nthat puts you on the prowl looking for deals.\n\nIs that something we should, in general, think about? Or is there\nregulatory issues that are still a concern? Just trying to figure out what\nthat other 50% is going to go towards this year.\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nWell, to start with, yes, the other 50% of cash that is -- will be\ngenerated that we will not use, that is beyond dividends. We only one use\nfor it -- 2 uses for it, we've always said. One is parking on balance sheet\nfor the opportunity to buy someone else. But in reality, we're buying big\nenough companies, you almost say that 50% cash is sitting there is not\nadequate.\n\nSo the likely use of that 50% cash is, as Kirsten indicated in her prepared\nremarks, pay down debt. We do intend to use part of that 50% free cash flow\nthat's not used for dividends to go de-lever ourselves, given the size of\nthe debt load we are taking on or we have taken on since we acquired\nVMware.\n\nKirsten M. Spears\nCFO & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nYes, Ross. It's Kirsten. We want to focus on reducing interest expense, so\nwe'll go after those term loans. So yes, the focus will be on paying down\ndebt.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd one moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Vivek\nArya with Bank of America.\n\nVivek Arya\nBofA Securities, Research Division\n\nHock, back to AI. What do you think is the SAM in 2024, so we can get a\nbaseline view of what your $12.2 billion in sales represent? And is your\nassumption that you maintain the share, right? You grow it? Or what happens\nto that share over time?\n\nAnd then sort of related question to that is what happens to your\nsemiconductor gross margins if AI grows, right, to such an extent? Because\nyou gave us a mid-single digit for non-AI. And I'm wondering, if AI gets to\nbe such a big part of semis, what happens to gross margin? So both kind of\nthe baseline of what the SAM was this year and what happens to your share\nand margins over time?\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nOkay. That's a very insightful question on the first one, which -- on the\nfirst one, anyway, where we are saying what is the baseline on the $60\nbillion to $90 billion in 3 years' time, where we are specifying down to\nthese 3 customers of ours. And I would estimate this 2024 for that to be\nabout less than $20 billion -- $15 billion to $20 billion at this point. In\n2024, $15 billion to $20 billion, going to $60 billion to $90 billion,\nright?\n\nAnd in terms of margins, well, don't get too hung up about gross margin\nplease, Vivek, because you're not wrong. Gross margin in semiconductors\nwill dilute, you're [ correct ] in saying that. But see, the game here is\nthe revenue will leverage so much on the spending we have to do to generate\nit that the operating margin will improve from where we are today.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Harsh\nKumar with Piper Sandler.\n\nHarsh V. Kumar\nPiper Sandler & Co., Research Division\n\nYes. First of all, guys, huge congratulations on successfully integrating\nVMware so much ahead of your time frame. And Hock, I had a 2-part question.\nIs there a simple dollar metric that we can think of for network attach to\nXPUs? For example, is $1 of networking to $1 of XPUs?\n\nAnd then for my question, in one of your posts, you talked about sovereign\ndata centers and VMware. I guess my question is, is there a play for\nBroadcom outside of the software piece? In other words, are you noticing\nthat sovereign guys are wanting to use XPUs? Or are they strictly sticking\nto merchant silicon?\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nLet me answer your question backwards, the easiest one first. Sovereign\nguys are like most of the other -- it's pretty much like enterprise market,\nwhich is simply merchant. Sovereign guys do not have the capability\nnecessarily to create first, the hardware, but more importantly, the\nsoftware stack to enable transistors in the hardware to translate itself\ninto high-level language, which then the LLM, the large language models,\nand AI applications can operate on. So they'll stick to what's available,\nwhich is merchant silicon and the available ecosystem of software layers\nthat allow that translation. So it will be done very much that way on XPUs.\n\nAnd on your first question of what's the ratio between AI connectivity,\nnetworking, that is you're saying, to XPUs, the compute, well, it's a\nchanging number as the cluster expands, though there are some ratios to be\nlooked at. And the simple ratio to look at is there is scale up and there\nis scale out. And as we expand into a single fabric cluster of XPUs or GPUs\nthat grows bigger and bigger, guess what is more important? Scale up\nbecomes more important. And the ratio we are talking about as we move up\nincreases almost exponentially, which is why I'm saying from probably\nnetworking as a percent of AI content in silicon today of between 5% to\n10%, you're going up to 15% to 20% by the time you hit 500,000 to 1 million\nXPU GPU clusters.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of\nToshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\n\nToshiya Hari\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\n\nThe $60 billion to $90 billion SAM forecast for fiscal '27, Hock, I'm\ncurious if you guys have a view on the TAM. So just want to know how big\nthe SAM is as a percentage of the total opportunity set.\n\nAnd then my main question is you talked about going for leading market\nshare within your SAM, which makes sense. I assume you're not assuming 100%\nshare. So the value of that $60 billion to $90 billion that you won't be\ncapturing, is that a function of some of your hyperscale customers wanting\nto capture value internally? Or is that always having a backup or a second\nsource? Is there a low-margin business that you just simply won't pursue?\nHow should we think about the part of the $60 billion to $90 billion that\nyou won't be going after or won't be capturing?\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nOkay. First, to answer the bigger overarching question, I don't know the\nTAM. I don't make any parts of the 2 -- I don't think too far and hard\nabout them. We don't think in macro approaches. We're looking at line of\nsight here. So I got customers, I try to figure out how much volume the --\nwhere the road map of the customer is, not just product, technology, but\nwhat they are building out, what is their consumption pattern like. That's\nhow we create our SAM. Actually, in a way, bottoms up, then top down. So I\nhave no idea what the TAM is beyond customers we are serving closely,\ncollaborating closely. So let's make it clear.\n\nIn terms of market share, I don't know. But as you all can see, it's a very\nlarge, substantial market opportunity. There's room for many players. All\nwe're going to do is gain our fair share. We're just very well positioned\ntoday having the best technology, very relevant in this space. We have, by\nfar, one of the best technology -- combination technology out there to do\nXPUs and to connect those XPUs.\n\nThe silicon technology that enables it, we have it here in Broadcom by the\nboatloads, which is why we are very well positioned with these 3 customers\nof ours. So we -- based on that, we are -- and based on the depth of our\nengagement today, this didn't just start. This has been going on now for a\nwhile in terms of deep engagement with engineering teams from the other\nside -- each of the other side. We are very well positioned, well underway\nto creating a multiyear road map for -- to enable these few customers of\nours to get to where their ambition leads them to be in. And it's because\nof the great technology we have, where we are actually enabling in the\nareas we're very good at. We're talking about silicon design, packaging\ndesign and optical technology.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of\nWilliam Stein with Truist Securities.\n\nWilliam Stein\nTruist Securities, Inc., Research Division\n\nI want to add my congrats to all the great results this year and for the\nquarter and outlook. But Hock, this is sort of a stunning turn of events in\nthe last year with what we've been accustomed to thinking of as a sort of\nmature, slow growth business at its core, with all the M&A tacked on to it.\nAnd I wonder, with the sudden acceleration of the organic business given\nyour exposure to these capabilities in ASICs to bring AI technologies to\ncustomers, does that change your interest level in M&A? And does it change\nyour focus area of potential M&A going forward?\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nNo, it doesn't. We are open, still open, always open because that's been a\ncore part of our strategy and business model of this company for the last\n10 years, which is we're always interested in adding to our portfolio very\ngood franchise assets, be they in semiconductors or be they in\ninfrastructure software. As long as, as we always say, they meet the\ncriteria, the fairly demanding criteria we look for, we would always be\nopen to acquiring these assets and adding into our portfolio. So no, it\nhasn't changed our thinking at all.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Vijay\nRakesh with Mizuho.\n\nVijay Raghavan Rakesh\nMizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division\n\nHock, great results here. Just a question back on the AI custom silicon\nside. I guess it looks like of the $17.5 billion TAM here -- or SAM here,\nyou have about 70% share. So assuming that 70% looking out to '27, your\ncustom silicon AI revenues should be like $50 billion in fiscal '27. So are\nwe -- do we have a good line of sight into fiscal '26, showing a pretty\nnice ramp to hit those numbers, maybe with Ultra Ethernet and all that to\ndo the 1 million XPUs? How do you see that?\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nI don't know. We don't have really a good enough line of sight to want to\nshare it with you nor, for that matter, do we have a policy of giving you\nguidance beyond what we're doing, 1 quarter a year. But we do want to give\nyou a sense of where this journey is headed. We want to give you a sense of\nwhere this could lead us, this company, in terms of its AI -- semiconductor\nAI revenue trajectory.\n\nGiven that we now made it very open, official almost, that we are going\nforward only are guiding AI revenue versus non-AI revenue, we figured at\nleast give you a sense of what the AI trajectory is. On the non-AI, we have\nknown it. You have known it with us for a long time. It's mature, it's\nstable, evolving, growing mid-single-digit GDP plus.\n\nAI, we've never given you that. So that's why we take this step now,\nunprecedented in some ways, of laying that road map in terms of potential\nmarket for AI.\n\nNow only market we have is the customers we have and the end markets we\nserve. So we create this SAM and we -- the clarity we see is, to some\nextent, in 2027. How that journey progresses with each of our customers is\nsomewhat variable. It's the rate of the adoption and how -- of their own\nXPUs, and we'll be very much a part of their journey. But because of that,\nwe expect to see a situation where there could be quarter-to-quarter\nvariability, given there are only 3 customers and the fact that deployment\ncomes in big chunks, typically. So my best answer to you is I can't give\nyou any clarity beyond what I've given so far.\n\nVijay Raghavan Rakesh\nMizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division\n\nGot it. And the other 2 CSPs, when do you see them ramping?\n\nHock E. Tan\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director\n\nWell, first of all, I got to get into production. They got to get into\nproduction. So why don't we cross that bridge when we get to it? We are\nworking very hard with them to get it production stage. We're pretty deeply\nengaged. We have tape-out chips. And -- but they got to get their software\nready, they got to get it tested, and they got to get going on it. So now,\nI'm not sure. But definitely, over the next 3 years.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd thank you. That is all the time we have for our question-and-answer\nsession. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ji Yoo, Head of\nInvestor Relations, for closing remarks.\n\nJi Yoo\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Sherry.

      "text": "President, CEO & Executive Director Thank you, Ji, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Well, this has been a transformative year for Broadcom. Our fiscal year 2024 consolidated revenue grew 44% year-over-year to a record $51.6 billion. Now excluding VMware, our revenue grew over 9% organically. So fiscal '24 operating profit, excluding transition costs, grew 42% year-over-year, and we returned a record $22 billion in cash to our shareholders, up 45% year- on-year through dividends, buybacks and eliminations. There were 2 significant drivers of this transformation this year. First, we closed the acquisition of VMware in the early weeks of fiscal '24 and have focused VMware on its technology leadership in data center virtualization. The integration of VMware is largely complete. Revenue is on a growth trajectory, and operating margin reached 70% exiting 2024. We are well on the path to delivering incremental adjusted EBITDA at a level that significantly exceeds the $8.5 billion we communicated when we announced the deal. We're planning to achieve this much earlier than our initial target of 3 years. The second driver in 2024 was AI. Our AI revenue, which came from strength in custom AI accelerators, or XPUs, and networking grew 220% from $3.8 billion in fiscal '23 to $12.2 billion in fiscal '24 and represented 41% of our semiconductor revenue. This drove semiconductor revenue up to a record $30.1 billion during the year. Okay. Now let's move on to the fourth quarter and give you more color. Consolidated net revenue of $14.1 billion was up 51% year-on-year. Excluding VMware, organic growth was 11%. And operating profit of $8.8 billion was up 53% year-on-year. For the details on infrastructure software in Q4, this infrastructure software segment revenue was $5.8 billion, up 196% year-on-year, flat sequentially, even as multiple deals slip over into Q1. In VMware, we booked $21 million total CPU costs in the quarter versus $19 million a quarter ago. Of these, about 70% represent the VMware Cloud Foundation of this year, the full software stack virtualizing the entire data center. And this translated into annualized booking value, or ABV as we call it, of $2.7 billion for VMware in Q4, up from $2.5 billion in Q3. Since closing the acquisition just over a year ago, we've signed up over 4,500 of our largest 10,000 customers for VCF. VCF enable customers to deploy private cloud environments on-prem as an alternative to running the applications in the public cloud. And in doing all this, we continue to drive down spending in VMware. We brought spending down to $1.2 billion in Q4, down from $1.3 billion in Q3. By reference, VMware spending was averaging over $2.4 billion per quarter prior to the acquisition with operating margin less than 30%. Moving on to Q1 outlook for infrastructure software. We expect Q1 revenue to grow to $6.5 billion, up 11% sequentially and 41% up year-on-year. For VMware, ABV is expected to exceed $3 billion compared to $2.7 billion in the preceding quarter. Turning to semiconductors. Let me give you more details by end markets. Networking. Q4 revenue of $4.5 billion grew 45% year-on-year. AI networking revenue, which represented 76% of networking, grew 158% year-on-year. This was driven by a doubling of our AI XPU shipments to our 3 hyperscale customers and 4x growth in AI connectivity revenue, driven by our Tomahawk and Jericho shipments globally. In Q1, we expect the momentum in AI connectivity to be as strong as more hyperscalers deploy Jericho3-AI in their fabrics. Our next-generation XPUs are in 3 nanometers and will be the first of its kind into market in that process node. We are on track for volume shipments at our hyperscale customers in the second half of fiscal '25. Turning on to server storage. From its bottom 6 months ago, Q4 server storage connectivity revenue has recovered some 20% to $992 million. And in Q4, we expect server storage revenue to continue to grow. Turning to wireless. As we expected, seasonal launch by our North American customer drove Q4 wireless revenue to $2.2 billion, up 30% sequentially. This was up 7% year-on-year because of higher content. We continue to be very engaged with this customer in multiyear road maps across various technologies we have leadership in, including RF, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, sensing and touch. In Q1, reflecting seasonality, we expect wireless to be down sequentially, but still be flat year-on-year. In Q4, broadband reached bottom at $465 million, down 51% year-on-year. We have seen significant orders across multiple service providers during this quarter. And reflecting this trend, we now expect broadband to show recovery beginning in Q1. Finally, on to industrial, which only represents 1% of the total revenues. Measured on resales, Q4 industrial resales of $173 million declined 27% year-on-year. We only expect a recovery in the second half 2025. Before I sum up and provide you Q1 fiscal '25 guidance, let me outline a longer-term perspective on how we see our semiconductor business evolving over the next 3 years. On the broad portfolio of non-AI semiconductors with its multiple end markets, we saw a cyclical bottom in fiscal '24 at $17.8 billion. We expect a recovery from this level and the industry's historical growth rate of mid-single digits. In sharp contrast, we see our opportunity over the next 3 years in AI as massive. Specific hyperscalers have begun their respective journeys to develop their own custom AI accelerators or XPUs as well as network these XPUs with open and scalable Ethernet connectivity. For each of them, this represents a multiyear, not a quarter-to-quarter journey. As you know, we currently have 3 hyperscale customers, who have developed their own multi-generational AI XPU road map to be deployed at varying rates over the next 3 years. In 2027, we believe each of them plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. We expect this to represent an AI revenue serviceable addressable market, or SAM, for XPUs and network in the range of $60 billion to $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. We are very well positioned to achieve a leading market share in this opportunity and expect this will drive a strong ramp from our 2024 AI revenue base of $12.2 billion. Keep in mind though, this will not be a linear ramp. We'll show quarterly variability. To compound this, we have been selected by 2 additional hyperscalers and are in advanced development for their own next-generation AI XPUs. We have line of sight to develop these prospects into revenue-generating customers before 2027 and could, therefore, expand this SAM significantly. So the reality going forward for this company is that the AI semiconductor business will rapidly outgrow the non-AI semiconductor business. Recognizing this, we will now shift to guiding our semiconductor business by AI and non-AI revenue segments. So summarizing Q4. Semiconductor revenue of $8.2 billion grew 12% year-on- year and 13% sequentially. Q4 AI revenue grew a strong 150% year-on-year to $3.7 billion. Non-AI semiconductor revenue declined by 23% year-on-year to $4.5 billion, but still a 10% recovery from the bottom of 6 months ago. Now moving on to our outlook for Q1. We expect semiconductor revenue to grow approximately 10% year-on-year to $8.1 billion. AI demand remains strong and we expect AI revenue to grow 65% year-on-year to $3.8 billion. We expect non-AI semiconductor revenue to be down about mid-teens percent year-on-year. And so in total, summing this all up, we're guiding consolidated Q1 revenue to be approximately $14.6 billion, up 22% year-on- year. And we expect this will drive Q1 adjusted EBITDA to approximately 66% of revenue. With that, let me turn this call over to Kirsten.",

      "role": "CFO & Chief Accounting Officer",
      "text": "CFO & Chief Accounting Officer Thank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our Q4 financial performance. Consolidated revenue was $14.1 billion for the quarter, up 51% from a year ago. Excluding the contribution from VMware, Q4 revenue increased 11% year-on-year. Gross margins were 76.9% of revenue in the quarter, up 260 basis points from the year ago quarter. R&D was $1.4 billion, and consolidated operating expenses were $2 billion, up year-on- year primarily due to the acquisition and consolidation of VMware. Q4 operating income was $8.8 billion and was up 53% from a year ago, with operating margin at 63% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $9.1 billion or 65% of revenue. This figure excludes $156 million of depreciation. Now a review of the P&L for our 2 segments, starting with semiconductors. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $8.2 billion and represented 59% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 12% year-on- year. Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 67%, down 220 basis points year-on-year, driven primarily by a higher mix of AI XPUs. Operating expenses increased 11% year-on-year to $914 million on increased investment in R&D, resulting in semiconductor operating margins of 56%. Now moving on to infrastructure software. Revenue for infrastructure software was $5.8 billion, up 196% year-on-year primarily due to the contribution of VMware and represented 41% of revenue. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 91% in the quarter. And operating expenses were $1.1 billion in the quarter, resulting in infrastructure software operating margin of 72%. Excluding transition costs, operating margin was 73%. Moving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $5.5 billion and represented 39% of revenues. Excluding cash used for restructuring and integration of $506 million, free cash flows of $6 billion were up 22% year- on-year and represented 43% of revenue. Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue has declined from the same quarter a year ago due to higher cash interest expense from debt related to the VMware acquisition, higher cash taxes due to a higher mix of U.S. taxable income, the continued delay in the reenactment of Section 174, and recent proposed regulations on corporate AMT. We spent $122 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 29 days in the fourth quarter compared to 31 days a year ago. We ended the fourth quarter with inventory of $1.8 billion, down 7% sequentially. We continue to remain disciplined on how we manage inventory across the ecosystem. We ended the fourth quarter with $9.3 billion of cash and $69.8 billion of gross principal debt. During the quarter, we replaced $5 billion of floating rate debt with new senior notes. We used cash on hand to pay a mix of senior notes, which came due in Q4, and additional floating rate debt, reducing debt by $2.5 billion. Following these actions, the weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $56 billion in fixed rate debt is 3.7% and 7.6 years, respectively. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $14 billion in floating rate debt is 5.9% and 3.2 years, respectively. We expect to repay approximately $495 million of fixed rate senior notes coming due in Q1. Now let me recap our financial performance for fiscal year 2024. Our revenue hit a record $51.6 billion, growing 44% year-on-year, including VMware, and 9% organically, excluding VMware. Semiconductor revenue was $30.1 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Infrastructure software revenue was $21.5 billion, up 181% year-on-year and up 19% year-on-year, excluding VMware. Fiscal 2024 adjusted EBITDA was $31.9 billion and represented 62% of revenue. Free cash flow grew 10% year-on-year to $19.4 billion and up 22% year-on-year to $21.9 billion, excluding restructuring and integration costs. Turning to capital allocation. For fiscal 2024, we spent $22.2 billion, consisting of $9.8 billion in the form of cash dividends and $12.4 billion in share repurchases and eliminations. Aligned with our ability to generate increased cash flows in the preceding year and off of a larger share count base from the acquisition of VMware, we are announcing an increase in our quarterly common stock cash dividend in Q1 fiscal 2025 to $0.59 per share on a split-adjusted basis, an increase of 11% from the prior quarter. We intend to maintain this target quarterly dividend throughout fiscal '25, subject to quarterly board approval. This implies that our fiscal 2025 annual common stock dividend to be a record $2.36 per share on a split-adjusted basis, an increase of 12% year- on-year. I would like to highlight that this represents the 14th consecutive increase in annual dividends since we initiated dividends in fiscal 2011. Now moving on to guidance. From a year-on-year comparable basis, keep in mind that Q1 of fiscal '24 was a 14-week quarter and Q1 of fiscal '25 is a 13-week quarter. As we are now past 1 year following the close of the VMware acquisition, starting in Q1 of fiscal 2025, we will no longer break out VMware revenue and costs on a stand-alone basis. We will continue to report infrastructure software segment revenue and profitability, which includes Brocade Fibre Channel SAN, CA mainframe, enterprise security, and VMware. Our guidance for Q1 is for consolidated revenue of $14.6 billion, with semiconductor revenue of $8.1 billion, up approximately 10% year-on-year, and infrastructure software revenue of $6.5 billion, up 41% year-on-year. We expect Q1 adjusted EBITDA to be a record 66% and Q1 non-GAAP diluted share count to be approximately 4.9 billion shares. For modeling purposes, we expect Q1 consolidated gross margins to be up 100 basis points sequentially on the higher revenue mix of infrastructure software and product mix within semiconductors. Note that consolidated gross margins through the year will be impacted by the revenue mix of infrastructure software and semiconductors and product mix within semiconductors. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate in fiscal year 2025 to be approximately 14.5% as tax deductions related to interest expense are reduced as we pay down and refinance debt under more favorable interest terms. GAAP net income and cash flows in Q1 will be impacted by higher taxes, restructuring and integration-related cash costs due to the VMware acquisition. That concludes my prepared remarks.

And it's serviceable addressable market for 3 of our hyperscale customers. That's it. It's a very narrow serviceable addressable market we're talking about.

And so you guys hear the differences of when you do these racks, you have what you call scale out. And then you have joining rack to rack because you have no choice. You can't get to 1 million or for that matter 100,000 otherwise. You call it scale out. And that's a continuing evolving architecture. But I think each of these hyperscale customers of ours have, at this point, kind of figured out how to get there. Hence, a road map that will keep growing from 100,000 to 1 million XPU cluster on pretty much similar architecture basis over the next 3, 4 years.",

So for example, our latest roll up is that the top 4 cloud and hyperscalers are going to grow their CapEx 35%, 40% in fiscal '25. I would expect that your AI business would sort of closely mirror this trend, maybe even think about it as a base case when we think about Ethernet taking share from InfiniBand, ASICs growing faster than merchant GPUs.

So the likely use of that 50% cash is, as Kirsten indicated in her prepared remarks, pay down debt. We do intend to use part of that 50% free cash flow that's not used for dividends to go de-lever ourselves, given the size of the debt load we are taking on or we have taken on since we acquired VMware.",

And is your assumption that you maintain the share, right? You grow it? Or what happens to that share over time? And then sort of related question to that is what happens to your semiconductor gross margins if AI grows, right, to such an extent? Because you gave us a mid-single digit for non-AI. And I'm wondering, if AI gets to be such a big part of semis, what happens to gross margin?

And I would estimate this 2024 for that to be about less than $20 billion -- $15 billion to $20 billion at this point. In 2024, $15 billion to $20 billion, going to $60 billion to $90 billion, right? And in terms of margins, well, don't get too hung up about gross margin please, Vivek, because you're not wrong. Gross margin in semiconductors will dilute, you're [ correct ] in saying that. But see, the game here is the revenue will leverage so much on the spending we have to do to generate it that the operating margin will improve from where we are today.",

And Hock, I had a 2-part question. Is there a simple dollar metric that we can think of for network attach to XPUs? For example, is $1 of networking to $1 of XPUs? And then for my question, in one of your posts, you talked about sovereign data centers and VMware. I guess my question is, is there a play for Broadcom outside of the software piece? In other words, are you noticing that sovereign guys are wanting to use XPUs? Or are they strictly sticking to merchant silicon?",

      "text": "President, CEO & Executive Director Let me answer your question backwards, the easiest one first. Sovereign guys are like most of the other -- it's pretty much like enterprise market, which is simply merchant. Sovereign guys do not have the capability necessarily to create first, the hardware, but more importantly, the software stack to enable transistors in the hardware to translate itself into high-level language, which then the LLM, the large language models, and AI applications can operate on. So they'll stick to what's available, which is merchant silicon and the available ecosystem of software layers that allow that translation. So it will be done very much that way on XPUs. And on your first question of what's the ratio between AI connectivity, networking, that is you're saying, to XPUs, the compute, well, it's a changing number as the cluster expands, though there are some ratios to be looked at. And the simple ratio to look at is there is scale up and there is scale out. And as we expand into a single fabric cluster of XPUs or GPUs that grows bigger and bigger, guess what is more important? Scale up becomes more important. And the ratio we are talking about as we move up increases almost exponentially, which is why I'm saying from probably networking as a percent of AI content in silicon today of between 5% to 10%, you're going up to 15% to 20% by the time you hit 500,000 to 1 million XPU GPU clusters.",

So just want to know how big the SAM is as a percentage of the total opportunity set. And then my main question is you talked about going for leading market share within your SAM, which makes sense. I assume you're not assuming 100% share. So the value of that $60 billion to $90 billion that you won't be capturing, is that a function of some of your hyperscale customers wanting to capture value internally? Or is that always having a backup or a second source? Is there a low-margin business that you just simply won't pursue? How should we think about the part of the $60 billion to $90 billion that you won't be going after or won't be capturing?",

I don't make any parts of the 2 -- I don't think too far and hard about them. We don't think in macro approaches. We're looking at line of sight here. So I got customers, I try to figure out how much volume the -- where the road map of the customer is, not just product, technology, but what they are building out, what is their consumption pattern like. That's how we create our SAM. Actually, in a way, bottoms up, then top down. So I have no idea what the TAM is beyond customers we are serving closely, collaborating closely. So let's make it clear. In terms of market share, I don't know. But as you all can see, it's a very large, substantial market opportunity. There's room for many players. All we're going to do is gain our fair share. We're just very well positioned today having the best technology, very relevant in this space. We have, by far, one of the best technology -- combination technology out there to do XPUs and to connect those XPUs. The silicon technology that enables it, we have it here in Broadcom by the boatloads, which is why we are very well positioned with these 3 customers of ours. So we -- based on that, we are -- and based on the depth of our engagement today, this didn't just start. This has been going on now for a while in terms of deep engagement with engineering teams from the other side -- each of the other side. We are very well positioned, well underway to creating a multiyear road map for -- to enable these few customers of ours to get to where their ambition leads them to be in. And it's because of the great technology we have, where we are actually enabling in the areas we're very good at. We're talking about silicon design, packaging design and optical technology.",

So assuming that 70% looking out to '27, your custom silicon AI revenues should be like $50 billion in fiscal '27.

We don't have really a good enough line of sight to want to share it with you nor, for that matter, do we have a policy of giving you guidance beyond what we're doing, 1 quarter a year. But we do want to give you a sense of where this journey is headed. We want to give you a sense of where this could lead us, this company, in terms of its AI -- semiconductor AI revenue trajectory. Given that we now made it very open, official almost, that we are going forward only are guiding AI revenue versus non-AI revenue, we figured at least give you a sense of what the AI trajectory is. On the non-AI, we have known it. You have known it with us for a long time. It's mature, it's stable, evolving, growing mid-single-digit GDP plus. AI, we've never given you that. So that's why we take this step now, unprecedented in some ways, of laying that road map in terms of potential market for AI. Now only market we have is the customers we have and the end markets we serve. So we create this SAM and we -- the clarity we see is, to some extent, in 2027. How that journey progresses with each of our customers is somewhat variable. It's the rate of the adoption and how -- of their own XPUs, and we'll be very much a part of their journey. But because of that, we expect to see a situation where there could be quarter-to-quarter variability, given there are only 3 customers and the fact that deployment comes in big chunks, typically.
