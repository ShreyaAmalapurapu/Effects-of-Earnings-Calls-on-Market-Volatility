NasdaqGS:GOOGL\nFQ2 2025 Earnings Call Transcripts\nWednesday, July 23, 2025 8:30 PM GMT\nS&P Global Market Intelligence Estimates\n\nPresentation\n\nOperator\n\nWelcome, everyone. Thank you for standing by for the Alphabet Second\nQuarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\n\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim\nFriedland, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Friedland\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's Second\nQuarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Sundar Pichai,\nPhilipp Schindler, and Anat Ashkenazi.\n\nNow I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make\ntoday regarding our business, operations and financial performance may be\nconsidered forward-looking. Such statements are based on current\nexpectations and assumptions that are subject to a number of risks and\nuncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Please refer to our\nForms 10-K and 10-Q, including the risk factors. We undertake no obligation\nto update any forward-looking statement.\n\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial\nmeasures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in\ntoday's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the\npublic through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.\nOur comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state\notherwise. And now I'll turn the call over to Sundar.\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was a standout quarter for us\nwith robust growth across the company. As you saw at IO, we are leading at\nthe frontier of AI and shipping at an incredible pace. AI is positively\nimpacting every part of the business, driving strong momentum.\n\nThis quarter, Search delivered double-digit revenue growth. Our new Search\nfeatures continue to perform well. AI Mode has launched in the U.S. and\nIndia and is going well, while AI Overviews now has over 2 billion monthly\nusers across more than 200 countries and territories and 40 languages. I'll\ngive some more details on Search in a moment.\n\nWe continue to see strong performance in YouTube as well as subscriptions,\nreflecting great momentum across these high-growth businesses. In the U.S.,\nshorts now earn as much revenue per watch hour as traditional in-stream on\nYouTube. And in some countries, it now even exceeds in-stream's rate. Cloud\nhad another great quarter of strong growth in revenues, backlog and\nprofitability. Its annual revenue run rate is now more than $50 billion. We\nare seeing significant demand for our comprehensive AI product portfolio.\n\nOf course, this is all possible because of the long-term investments we\nhave made in our differentiated full stack approach to AI. This spans AI\ninfrastructure, world-class research, models and tooling and our products\nand platforms that brings AI to people all over the world. I'll briefly\ntouch on the AI stack before turning to quarterly highlights.\n\nFirst, AI infrastructure. We operate the leading global network of AI-\noptimized data centers and cloud regions. We also offer the industry's\nwidest range of TPUs and GPUs along with storage and software built on top.\nThat's why nearly all GenAI unicorns use Google Cloud. And that's why a\ngrowing number, including leading AI research labs like Safe\nSuperintelligence and Physical Intelligence use TPU specifically. Our AI\ninfrastructure investments are crucial to meeting the growth in demand from\ncloud customers.\n\nNext, world-class AI research, including models and tooling. We continue to\nexpand our Gemini 2.5 family of hybrid reasoning models, which provide\nindustry-leading performance in nearly every major benchmark. In addition\nto improving our popular workhorse model Flash, we debuted an extremely\nfast flashlight version. We achieved gold medal level performance in the\nInternational Math Olympiad using an advanced version of Gemini with\nDeepting. We can't wait to bring Deepting to users soon. We have some of\nthe best models available today at every price point. Our 2.5 models have\nbeen a catalyst for growth and 9 million developers have now built with\nGemini.\n\nI also want to mention Veo 3, our state-of-the-art video generation model.\nIt's been a viral hit with people sharing clips created in the Gemini app\nand with our new AI filmmaking tool Flow. Since May, over 70 million videos\nhave been generated using Veo 3. And we recently introduced a feature in\nthe Gemini app to turn photos into videos, which people absolutely love.\nIt's also rolling out to Google Photos users starting today. Third, our\nproducts and platforms. We are bringing AI to all our users and partners\nthrough surfaces like Workspace, Chrome and more. The growth in usage has\nbeen incredible. At IO in May, we announced that we processed 480 trillion\nmonthly tokens across our surfaces. Since then, we have doubled that\nnumber, now processing over 980 trillion monthly tokens, a remarkable\nincrease.\n\nThe Gemini app now has more than 450 million monthly active users, and we\ncontinue to see strong growth in engagement with daily requests growing\nover 50% from Q1. In June alone, over 50 million people used AI-powered\nmeeting notes in Google Meet. And powered by Veo 3, our new short video\nproduct in Workspace called Google Vids reached nearly 1 million monthly\nactive users. This month at Samsung Galaxy Unpacked, we announced new\nAndroid and AI features that are available on Samsung's latest devices. And\nwe are really pleased with the growth in subscriptions, which got a boost\nfrom our Google AI Pro and Ultra plans.\n\nNow some key highlights from Search, Cloud, YouTube and Waymo for the\nquarter. First up, this is an incredibly exciting moment for Search. We see\nAI powering an expansion in how people are searching for and accessing\ninformation, unlocking completely new kinds of questions you can ask\nGoogle. Overall queries and commercial queries on Search continue to grow\nyear-over-year. And our new AI experiences significantly contributed to\nthis increase in usage. We are also seeing that our AI features cause users\nto search more as they learn that search can meet more of their needs.\nThat's especially true for younger users.\n\nLet me go deeper on our new search experiences. We know how popular AI\nOverviews are because they are now driving over 10% more queries globally\nfor the types of queries that show them, and this growth continues to\nincrease over time. AI Overviews are now powered by Gemini 2.5, delivering\nthe fastest AI responses in the industry. We also saw strong growth in the\nuse of multimodal search, particularly the combination of lens or Circle to\nSearch together with AI overviews. This growth was most pronounced among\nyounger users.\n\nOur new end-to-end AI search experience, AI Mode continues to receive very\npositive feedback, particularly for longer and more complex questions. It's\nstill rolling out, but already has over 100 million monthly active users in\nthe U.S. and India. We plan to keep enhancing the AI Mode experience for\nusers by shipping great features fast. That includes our advanced research\ntool Deep Search and more personalized responses.\n\nNext, Google Cloud. We see strong customer demand, driven by our product\ndifferentiation and our comprehensive AI product portfolio. Four stats show\nthis. One, the number of deals over $250 million, doubling year-over-year;\ntwo, in the first half of 2025, we signed the same number of deals over $1\nbillion that we did in all of 2024. Three, the number of new GCP customers\nincreased by nearly 28% quarter-over-quarter; four, more than 85,000\nenterprises, including LVMH, Salesforce and Singapore's DBS Bank now build\nwith Gemini, driving a 35x growth in Gemini usage year-over-year.\n\nOur models have served on our AI infrastructure, which offers industry-\nleading performance and cost efficiency for both training and inference.\nAlong with our AI accelerators, we introduced new innovations in storage,\nincluding Anywhere Cache, which improves inference latency by up to 70% and\nrapid storage, which delivers a 5x improvement in latency compared to\nleading hyperscalers. In addition, we have optimized AI software packages,\nincluding PyTorch and JAX with full open source supports for various AI\ntraining and serving demands.\n\nWe've also integrated AI agents deeply into each of our cloud products.\nWayfair is leveraging our databases integrated with AI to streamline data\npipelines and deliver more personalized customer experiences. Vantel is\nleveraging our Gemini-powered data agents and BigQuery to review and act on\nproduct feedback more quickly. Target is using our Gemini-powered threat\nintelligence and security operations agents to improve cybersecurity.\nCapgemini is utilizing our AI software engineering agents to deliver higher-\nquality software faster by automating tasks from code generation to\ntesting. And BBVA says Gemini and Google Workspace is saving employees\nnearly 3 hours per week by automating repetitive tasks. It's now rolling it\nout to 100,000 employees globally.\n\nWe are also focused on building a flourishing AI agent ecosystem. We\nintroduced an open source agent development kit, which now has over 1\nmillion downloads in less than 4 months. We also introduced Agentspace, an\nopen and interoperable enterprise chat search and agent platform. Gordon\nFood Service is bringing Agentspace to its U.S. employees, which is\nenabling better, more efficient decision-making. And over 1 million\nsubscriptions have been booked for Agentspace ahead of its general\navailability.\n\nTurning now to YouTube. Nielsen data shows YouTube has led U.S. streaming\nwatch time for over 2 years. A generation that grew up with YouTube on\ntheir devices is now increasingly watching their favorite creators and\ncontent on their televisions. That includes billions of sports fans, too.\nGlobally, they consume more than 40 billion hours of sports content on\nYouTube annually. And in September, we'll stream the NFL's first Friday\ngame of the season, live from Brazil.\n\nFrom sports to shorts, we now average over 200 billion daily views on\nYouTube Shorts. AI is helping improve our recommendations and auto dubbing,\nwhich translates to better returns for creators and brands by dramatically\nincreasing the potential audiences they can reach. And today, we began\nrolling out a whole draft of new AI tools for creators on YouTube Shorts.\n\nFinally, YouTube continues to diversify its subscription options, recently\nexpanding its premium light offerings to 15 new countries with more to\ncome. And lastly, Waymo continues to scale and expand to safely serve more\nriders in more places. Last month, Waymo launched in Atlanta, more than\ndoubled its Austin service territory and expanded its Los Angeles and San\nFrancisco Bay Area territories by approximately 50%. Waymo also launched\nteen accounts, starting with riders aged 14 to 17 in Phoenix. Overall,\ngreat momentum here. The Waymo driver has now autonomously driven over 100\nmillion miles on public roads. And the team is testing across more than 10\ncities this year, including New York and Philadelphia. We hope to serve\nriders in all 10 in the future.\n\nAs I said, a standout quarter. A big thank you, as always, to our employees\nand partners for an amazing Q2. Philipp, over to you.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\nSenior Vice President & Chief Business Officer of Google\n\nThanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. I'll quickly cover performance for\nGoogle Services for the quarter, then structure the rest of my remarks\naround the great progress we're delivering across search, ads, YouTube and\npartnerships. Google Services revenues were $83 billion for the quarter, up\n12% year-on-year, driven by strong growth in Search and YouTube, partially\noffset by year-on-year decline in network revenues.\n\nTo add some further color to our results. The 12% increase in Search and\nother revenues was led by growth across all verticals with the largest\ncontributions from retail and financial services. YouTube saw similar\nperformance across verticals. It's 13% growth in advertising revenues was\ndriven by direct response followed by brand. Starting with search and other\nrevenues, which delivered over $54 billion in revenue for the quarter.\nShifts like AI are what propels our industry forward. Gemini's native\nmultimodality is helping bring the offline audio and visual world back into\nthe online world, creating a number of opportunities for Search. Let me\nshare a few examples.\n\nTake visual queries. Google Lens search is one of the fastest-growing query\ntypes on Search and grew 70% since this time last year. Majority of lens\nsearches are incremental, and we're seeing healthy growth for shopping\nqueries using lens. And you can obviously take this to the next level by\nmoving from image to video-based capabilities like Search Live. And then\nthere's Circle to Search, which is now in over 300 million Android devices.\nWe've been adding capabilities to help people explore complex topics and\nask follow-up questions without switching apps. For example, gamers can now\nuse Circle to Search while playing mobile games to see an AI overview or\nanswers. And just last week, we brought in new agentic capability directly\ninto search for all U.S. users with AI-powered calling to local businesses.\n\nFinally, shopping, where in Q2, we introduced a virtual trial experience\nfor search labs users in the U.S. Now people can try billions of clothing\nproducts on themselves virtually. Early results and engagement have been\nextremely positive, particularly with Gen Z users and we'll be bringing\nthis functionality to all U.S. users imminently.\n\nAll these innovations are opening up completely new ways for people to use\ntechnology, bringing the off-line world into the online world in ways that\nsimply have not been possible before. Add in our amazing AI translation\ncapabilities and just imagine the possibilities. People can access more\ncontent in the language and businesses, large and small, international or\nlocal can reach even more customers. I'm excited about how all of these\nelements will come together and the opportunities ahead of us in Search.\n\nMoving to ads where our strategy to reinvent the entire marketing process\nwith AI is delivering value for our customers and our business. Last\nquarter, we introduced AI Max and Search, a new suite of AI-powered\nfeatures in existing search campaigns. Advertisers that activate AI Max and\nSearch campaigns typically see 14% more conversions. On media buying, Smart\nBidding Exploration, the biggest update to bidding strategy in a decade\nbrings better performance to advertisers by allowing them to bid on a less\nobvious but potentially higher value queries more often.\n\nCampaigns using Smart Bidding Exploration, see a 19% increase in\nconversions on average. Demand gen continues to drive revenue growth and\ndeliver measurable impact for our customers. As an example, Depop, Etsy's\nresell clothing marketplace used a short only demand gen campaign to drive\nnew customers to the site. Short drove 80% buyer brand load and double\nclick-through rates versus benchmarks. On creatives, we launched Asset\nStudio using our latest models to help businesses, large and small,\ngenerate creative assets. Small businesses benefit from top quality assets\nand deployment scaling capabilities, but larger businesses can go faster\nfrom proof of concept to launch and resize at lower cost. Over 2 million\nadvertisers now use Google's AI powered asset generation tools to run ads,\na 50% increase on this time last year.\n\nTurning to YouTube, where we saw continued strong revenue growth driven by\ndirect response followed by brand. YouTube creators are connected to the\nglobal site guys and trusted by their audiences like no others. As part of\nBrand Connect, we launched Creator partnership hub, which allows brands to\nmore easily work with the right creators and tap into cultural moments. We\nintroduced Veo 3, photo to video and generative effects to shorts, making\ncontent creation easier and offering unexplored avenues for creativity.\nWe're seeing both the volume and the price of ads and shorts increase,\nparticularly in developed markets. The feed-based nature of the product\nallows for more ad opportunities on average, and this growth is further\nsupported by ad formats native to shorts, AI-powered ad creative resizing\ntools, improved ad targeting and the rise in viewer engagement.\n\nMcDonald's U.S.A. harnessed the influence of YouTube creators to ignite\nawareness for the Minecraft movie meal. It leveraged YouTube Shorts\npartnership adds to increase its reach, generating a 3.3x higher view\nthrough rate than the industry benchmark.\n\nFinally, on CTV where the momentum continues. According to the gauge report\nby Nielsen, YouTube has been #1 in streaming watch time in the U.S. for\nmore than 2 years, hitting a record high of 12.8% of total TV viewing in\nJune 2025. In the past 12 months, YouTube ads viewed on CTV screens drove\nover 1 billion conversions. We saw strong growth in retail thanks to CTV\nshopping ads, which allows viewers to shop directly via QR codes, helping\nus leverage direct marketing opportunities. As always, I'll wrap up with\nthe momentum we're seeing in partnerships, where our customers increasingly\nrecognize the strength and breadth of Google's ability to help them\ntransform their business with AI.\n\nFor instance, a new partnership with PayPal will improve the digital\ncommerce experience for their merchants and customers. PayPal will expand\nits Google Cloud adoption for AI-driven recommendations, transaction\nprocessing and enhanced security. The partnership also broadens the\navailability and functionality of PayPal's payment services and\ncapabilities across a range of Google products.\n\nIn closing, I'd like to thank Googlers everywhere for their contributions\nand commitment to our success and to our customers and partners for their\ncontinued trust. Anat, over to you.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Philipp. My comments will focus on year-over-year comparisons\nfor the second quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with the\nresults at the Alphabet level and will then cover our segment results. I'll\nend with some commentary on our outlook for the second half of 2025. We had\nanother solid quarter in Q2. Consolidated revenue of $96.4 billion\nincreased by 14% or 13% in constant currency.\n\nSearch and YouTube advertising, subscription platforms and devices and\nGoogle Cloud each had double-digit revenue growth this quarter reflecting\nstrong momentum across the business. Total cost of revenue was $39 billion,\nup 10%. Tech was $14.7 billion, up 10%; and other cost of revenue was $24.3\nbillion, up 10%, with the increase primarily driven by content acquisition\ncosts, largely for YouTube, followed by depreciation. Total operating\nexpenses increased 20% to $26.1 billion. The biggest driver of growth was\nexpense for legal and other matters, which reflected the impact of $1.4\nbillion charge related to a settlement in principle of certain legal\nmatters.\n\nR&D investments increased by 16%, primarily driven by increases in\ncompensation and depreciation expenses. Sales and marketing expenses\nincreased 5%, primarily reflecting an increase in advertising and\npromotional expenses. Operating income increased 14% this quarter to $31.3\nbillion and operating margin was 32.4%. Operating margin benefited from\nstrong revenue growth and continued efficiencies in our expense base,\npartially offset by the legal charge I mentioned earlier, and a significant\nincrease in depreciation expense. Net income increased 19% to $28.2\nbillion, and earnings per share increased 22% to $2.31.\n\nWe generated free cash flow of $5.3 billion in the second quarter and $66.7\nbillion for the trailing 12 months. Free cash flow in the second quarter\nwas affected by a sizable sequential increase in CapEx and cash tax\npayments as we make federal tax payments in the second quarter for both Q1\nand Q2. We ended the quarter with $95 billion in cash and marketable\nsecurities.\n\nTurning to segment results. Google Services revenues increased 12% to $82.5\nbillion reflecting strength in Google Search and YouTube advertising and\nsubscriptions.\n\nGoogle Search and other revenues increased by 12% to $54.2 billion. Search\nand other revenues delivered growth across all verticals with the largest\ncontributions coming from retail and financial services. YouTube\nadvertising revenues increased 13% to $9.8 billion, driven by direct\nresponse advertising, followed by brand. Network advertising revenue of\n$7.4 billion were down 1%.\n\nSubscription platforms and devices revenues increased 20% to $11.2 billion,\nprimarily reflecting growth in subscription revenues. This growth was\ndriven by YouTube subscription offerings followed by Google One, with the\ngrowth in paid subscriptions being the biggest driver of revenue growth.\nGoogle Services operating income increased 11% to $33.1 billion.\n\nOperating margin was flat year-on-year at 40.1% as healthy revenue growth\nand continued efficiency in our expense base were partially offset by the\nlegal charge I mentioned earlier. Turning to the Google Cloud segment,\nwhich delivered very strong results this quarter. Revenues increased by 32%\nto $13.6 billion in the second quarter, reflecting growth in GCP across\ncore and AI products at the rate that was much higher than cloud's overall\nrevenue growth and growth in Google Workspace, driven by an increase in\naverage revenue per seat and the number of seats.\n\nGoogle Cloud operating income increased to $2.8 billion, and operating\nmargin increased from 11.3% to 20.7%. The expansion in cloud operating\nmargin was driven by strong revenue performance and continued efficiencies\nin our expense base partially offset by higher technical infrastructure\nusage costs, which includes the associated depreciation. As we ramp our AI\ninvestments, we continue to focus on driving improvements in productivity\nand efficiency to offset growth in technical infrastructure-related\nexpenses, particularly from higher depreciation. Google Cloud backlog\nincreased 18% sequentially in Q2 and 38% year-over-year, reaching $106\nbillion at the end of the quarter.\n\nThis growth was driven by strong demand for our products and services from\nboth new and existing customers. As Sundar mentioned, we have signed\nmultiple billion dollar plus deals in the first half of the year. As to our\nOther Bets in the second quarter, revenue were $373 million, and operating\nloss was $1.2 billion. Within Other Bets, we're allocating more resources\nto businesses like Waymo, where we see opportunities to create additional\nvalue. With respect to CapEx in the second quarter, our CapEx was $22.4\nbillion. The vast majority of our CapEx was invested in technical\ninfrastructure with approximately 2/3 of investments in servers and 1/3 in\ndata centers and networking equipment. In Q2, we returned capital to\nshareholders through repurchase of stock of $13.6 billion and dividend\npayments of $2.5 billion.\n\nTurning to our outlook. I would like to provide some commentary on several\nfactors that will impact our business performance in the second half of\n2025 as well as an updated outlook for full year CapEx. First, in terms of\nrevenues, we're pleased with the overall momentum we're seeing across the\nbusiness. At current spot rates, we could see a tailwind to our revenue in\nQ3. However, volatility in exchange rates could affect the impact of FX on\nQ3 revenue. As for our segments in Google Services, advertising revenues in\nthe second half of 2025 will be affected by the following: The continued\nlapping of the strength we experienced in financial service verticals\nthroughout 2024 and year-over-year comparisons will be negatively impacted\nby the strong spend on U.S. Election in the second half of 2024 and\nparticularly on YouTube.\n\nIn Cloud, as I mentioned, the demand for our products is high as evidenced\nby the continued revenue growth and the cloud backlog of $106 billion.\nWhile we have been working hard to increase capacity and have improved the\npace of server deployment, we expect to remain in a tight demand supply\nenvironment going into 2026.\n\nMoving to investments. Given the strong demand for our cloud products and\nservices, we now expect to invest approximately $85 billion in CapEx in\n2025, up from a previous estimate of $75 billion.\n\nOur updated outlook reflects additional investment in servers, the timing\nof delivery of servers and an acceleration in the pace of data center\nconstruction, primarily to meet cloud customer demand. Looking out to 2026,\nwe expect a further increase in CapEx due to the demand we're seeing from\ncustomers as well as growth opportunities across the company. We will\nprovide more details on the 2026 CapEx outlook on a future earnings call.\nIn terms of expenses, first, as I mentioned in our previous earnings call,\nthe significant increase in our investments in CapEx over the past few\nyears will continue to put pressure on the P&L, primarily in the form of\nhigher depreciation.\n\nIn the second quarter, depreciation increased $1.3 billion year-over-year\nto $5 billion, reflecting a growth rate of 35%. Given the recent increase\nin CapEx investments, we expect the growth rate and depreciation to\naccelerate further in Q3. Second, as we've previously said, we expect some\nheadcount growth in 2025 in key investment areas. In the third quarter, we\nexpect a sequential increase in total headcount additions due in part to\nthe hiring of new graduates.\n\nAnd third, Q3 will reflect the expense associated with the upcoming August\nlaunch of the new Pixel family of products. In conclusion, as you heard\nfrom Sundar and Philipp, we're pleased with the momentum in the business\nand excited about the pace of innovation. Our full stack approach, which\ncombines AI infrastructure, AI research and AI products and platforms\nposition us well to deliver new products and services across the company.\nWe're seeing great momentum with our efforts as demonstrated by the\nincrease in cumulative token processed. Search revenues are seeing healthy\ngrowth with features like AI Overviews, AI Mode and Lens, offering new ways\nfor users to access the information.\n\nCloud has reached an annual revenue run rate of more than $50 billion and\nis delivering margin expansion while continue to invest to meet customer\ndemand. And YouTube has expanded its addressable market by building new\nservices like shorts which now averages over 200 billion daily views. We're\nexcited to see the value our products and services are bringing to\ncustomers and partners around the globe.\nNow I'll turn it over to the operator, and Sundar and Philipp and I will\ntake your questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Eric Sheridan with\nGoldman Sachs.\n\nEric James Sheridan\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\n\nMaybe one for Sundar and one for Philipp. Sundar, when you think about the\njourney you're on with respect to the evolution of products and platforms.\nHow do you think about some of the implications of changed consumer\nbehavior and how investors should think about that from the volume\nperspective versus the monetization perspective. So I think there's a lot\nof long-standing dynamics out there about clicks and click monetization\nthat might be very different when you look out over the next 3 to 5 years.\n\nAnd Philipp, when you think about the evolution of YouTube, you made a\nnumber of comments there about subscription revenue. I'm just curious how\nyou think about the mix of advertising versus subscription? And what some\nof your key learnings might have been as the subscription side of the\nbusiness continues to scale?\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Eric. I appreciate the question. I don't think looking ahead, based\non everything we are seeing, it's -- people are excited about AI. They are\nadopting it well across our products. For me just in multimodality how\npeople have modified their behavior to include images, both through Lens\nand Circle to Search seamlessly as part of interacting with Google are\nearly indications that people are going to be adopting through these\nmoments very, very well.\n\nI think I'm trying to understand your question in terms of about clicks and\nclick monetization, maybe that's something Philipp can touch on. But\noverall, we expect as we build out our organic experiences. We have a good\nunderstanding of how to continue training on monetization, so that will\nwork well with organic experiences. And -- but we will lead with the\norganic experience.\n\nSo in terms of newer surfaces like Gemini app, et cetera, we'll focus on\nthe organic experience for the near term. But just like we are doing with\nAI Overviews and with AI Mode over time, we'll be able to bring very, very\ngood commercial experiences there as well. And we think people will adapt\nto them as they've always done. Maybe Philipp can add more. Philipp?\n\nPhilipp Schindler\nSenior Vice President & Chief Business Officer of Google\n\nYes. So on your question on YouTube subscriptions versus ads, look, I mean\nwe love our ads business. We love our subscription business. YouTube\nsubscriptions are increasingly important for YouTube. We'll definitely\ncontinue our long-term focus here. We had a strong growth across the\nYouTube subscription products, which includes, just to be clear, YouTube\nTV, YouTube Music and Premium. And I think one common theme for our\nsubscription services in general is offering viewers more choice here. We\nalso have a very deep understanding of the monetization side here. Where\nare we monetizing more with ads, where can we potentially monetize more\nwith subscriptions. So I think we will continue this as a double tier\nstrategy actively going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\n\nDouglas Till Anmuth\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nOne for Sundar and one for Philipp. Sundar, can you just talk about how\nyou're thinking about your current access to compute even as you spend $10\nbillion more this year in CapEx, you also said that you're still in a tight\nsupply environment. So just trying to marry those?\n\nAnd then Philipp, perhaps on search growth, can you talk a little bit about\nPayclick and pricing growth just within the 12% search growth? And how we\nshould think about volume versus monetization trends going forward?\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nDoug, on the CapEx stuff, obviously, we are seeing strong momentum across\nour portfolio and especially in cloud. You are right. It's a tight supply\nenvironment. And we are investing more to expand, but there is obviously a\ntime delay between this additional investment will play out in future\nyears. And so that's why both of them are true at the same time. And -- but\nwe are planning ahead, and we are investing and -- but overall, it's\nexciting to see the traction, particularly in cloud. I think the\ncomprehensiveness of our AI portfolio breadth of our offerings, both\nproviding our models on GPUs and TPUs for our customers. All of that has\nbeen really driving demand. And so we are investing to match up to it.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\nSenior Vice President & Chief Business Officer of Google\n\nAnd on your paid click question, look, to be very clear, I think we said\nthis before, we manage the business to drive great outcomes for our users\nand an attractive ROI for our advertisers. We actually don't manage to pay\nclicks and CPC targets. Some of the product and policy changes we make\nactually drive better monetization at the expense of paid clicks. You will\nactually see in the 10-Q, pay clicks were up 4% year-on-year. But a number\nof factors affect these metrics from quarter-to-quarter, such as a few\nexamples, advertiser spending, product changes, policy changes, user\nengagement and so on. So it's really important when it comes to pay clicks\nand CPCs to avoid drawing like overly broad conclusions solely based on\nthese metrics.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\n\nBrian Thomas Nowak\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\n\nI have two. First one, Sundar, there's a lot of discussion about agentic\nsearch for commercial activities and agents that can be broadly deployed.\nMaybe could you just -- from a technology perspective, when you sit down\nwith the engineering teams working on some of these new agentic\ncapabilities that could come, what are some of the predominant\ntechnological hurdles they think need to be cleared in order to launch\nscalable agents for commercial queries, is the first one. And second one, I\nthink in the past, you've updated us on stats on sources of internal\nefficiency you've seen from GenAI-enabled capabilities. Any updates there?\nAnd then any sort of learnings on friction points that also need to be\novercome for some of these internal tools for GenAI?\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nLet me start with the first one on agentic capabilities. Look, overall, we\nare definitely, in many ways when we built 2.5 -- our series of 2.5 models,\nparticularly with Pro, et cetera. It's the direction where we are investing\nthe most. There's definitely exciting progress, including in the models we\nhaven't fully released yet. And the main gaps we're all trying to do is\nyou're obviously chaining a sequence of events. And so being able to do it\nreliably the latency compounds, the cost compounds and being able to do it\nreliably in a way for the users all of this comes together.\n\nIn each of this, we are making progress, and it all needs to kind of hang\ntogether. The good news is we are making robust progress. We think we are\nat the frontier there. And in all of these areas, when you look back on a\n12-month basis, you end up making the models much more efficient for any\ngiven capability. So the forward-looking trajectory, I think, will really\nunlock these agentic experiences. We see the potential being able to do\nthem, but they're a bit slow and costly and takes time, and sometimes are\nbrittle, right? But they're making progress on all of that. And I think\nthat's what will really unlock. And I expect 2026 to be the year in which\npeople kind of use agentic experiences more broadly, right? And so it's an\nexciting opportunity ahead.\n\nOn the second part, I think, when you say a source of generalization, I\npresume you're talking about how we are using all of this internally.\nAgain, given you've asked a question about agents, we are now beginning to\nroll out agentic coding journeys for our software engineers within the\ncompany. And it's been exciting to see just over the last few months,\nparticularly over the last few weeks, people are definitely doing more\nagentic workflows and software engineering as well internally.\n\nAnd that's a good example of the kind of the same experiences a few months\nago, had a lot of friction points, but we are overcoming it and people are\nbeginning to use internally on the coding side as well as in certain other\nareas of the company as well. So exciting progress. I expect it to be an\nactive area where we will roll out journeys for our users as well. So look\nforward to it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.\n\nMichael Brian Nathanson\nMoffettNathanson LLC\n\nSundar, I have two for you. At IO, you announced a partnership to Warby\nParker to develop glasses. So I wonder if you show your view of how\nimportant a cycle of new devices will be to further scale AI and do you\nenvision a world in which the more functional are essential to our consumer\nexperience. That's one. And secondly, how does Google Search with AI Mode\nusage different -- differs, sorry, versus Gemini stand-alone apps. So I'm\nwondering, are you seeing any differences in usage or the types of\nconsumers who go to the app versus who go to traditional search with AI?\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nOn the first thing, look, I think any time IO changes, you can drive new\nexperiences, including on hardware experiences too. So I think AI will\nparticularly enable. You long had the promise of glasses and other form\nfactors. But I think AI will spur a whole new wave of innovation there. We\nare super excited about our investment in glasses and found the experiences\nhave taken a dramatic step-up compared to the last iteration.\n\nSo I think it's been an exciting new emerging category, but I still expect\nphones to be at the center of the experience for the next 2 to 3 years at\nleast. And so I still think that's going to be phones, would continue to be\nat the center of the consumer experience. But we are excited about the\nemerging categories as well.\n\nOn your second question on AI Mode versus Gemini stand-alone app, broadly,\nthere are some use cases where you can get a great experience in both\nplaces, but there are use cases which are very specific. I think where the\nqueries are information-oriented but people really want to rely on the\ninformation, but I have the full power of AI. I think AI mode really shines\nin that. You can go there, and you know it's backed up. The Gemini models\nare using search deeply as a tool. And so it's on grounded in that search\nexperience. And I think users are responding very positively to it. And\nwhereas the Gemini stand-alone app, you see everything from -- people can\nhave a long conversation of chat just trying to pass time, right, in the\nGemini app.\n\nYou've seen early cases where people may get into it in a therapy like\nexperience, right? So these are all emerging experiences of what people do.\nAnd I think this is why I'm glad we have both surfaces and we can innovate\nin both of these areas. And of course, there will be areas which will be\ncommonly served by both applications. And over time, I think we can make\nexperience more seamless for our users.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Mark Shmulik with Bernstein.\n\nMark Elliott Shmulik\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\n\nSundar, it seems there's almost like a daily news report about the AI\ntalent war and high-profile folks moving around which is kind of like your\nperspective on how you think Google has been doing it both kind of\nattracting and retaining key AI talent. And Anat, along the similar lines,\nhow do we think about AI-related resourcing costs alongside kind of the\nstep up in capital investments required to go build for AI?\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nMark, on the first question, look, I think, we've gone through these\nmoments before. We've obviously always deeply invested in talent, including\nan AI talent for well over a decade now. And I think we have an\nextraordinary both breadth and depth of the talent. In my experience, the\ntop people look for a combination of they want to really be at the frontier\ndriving progress. And so the mission and how state-of-the-art, your workers\nmatter. So that's super important to them, access to compute resources and\naccess to your peers, right.\n\nWorking with the best people in the industry, and it's a combination of all\nof that and using it to drive impact. And I think we are pretty competitive\non all those fronts. And through this moment, we continue to -- I look at\nthe -- both our retention metrics as well as the new talent coming in and\nboth are healthy. I do know individual cases can make headlines, but when\nwe look at numbers deeply, I think we are doing very well through this\nmoment and we'll continue investing in the people and the talent and the\ncompute needed to make sure we are set up for the opportunity ahead. And\nmaybe I'll pass it on to Anat.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nYes, on the question on how we integrate this into our overall cost\nstructure. And I've mentioned before, having the benefit of having the full\nstack includes research, which is our people and one of our most critical\nresource. So we make sure that we invest appropriately to have the best and\nbrightest minds in the industry sitting here at Google and advancing our\ninnovation to customers. It is part of what you're seeing now in our\noperating expense line across the organization.\n\nBut we're also working hard to offset not just growth in investment across\nthe business. But also to ensure that we can allocate research\nappropriately. So Sundar mentioned earlier, the use of AI tools within the\ncompany. So that's another area where we can drive efficiency across the\nbusinesses to use these tools internally in terms of how we run the\norganization. Then we're continuing on the same efforts that I've talked\nabout before with regards to running the company with a high level of\ndiscipline, execution and driving efficiency across the business.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays.\n\nRoss Adam Sandler\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\n\nGreat. If I can ask two, that would be great. So the first one is on Search\nclick-through rates as a driver of monetization. So you guys have done a\ngreat job over the past decade of driving better ad relevancy and higher\nclick-through rates in Search. Just curious, as we look forward and we see\nlower ad impressions per SERP and all these things that are changing with\nAI overviews and different AI SERP formats. How do you feel about your\nability to drive CTR going forward? And then the second question is, it\nlooks like you're now working with OpenAI for some aspect of cloud\ninfrastructure. Just curious how that relationship might expand in the\nfuture?\n\nPhilipp Schindler\nSenior Vice President & Chief Business Officer of Google\n\nI can make the first one. Look, specifically referring to AI Overviews, if\nI understood your question correctly, as Sundar mentioned it, they continue\nto drive higher satisfaction. They continue to drive higher search usage.\nThey're scaling up very nicely and they're actually working for our entire\nuser base now scaled to over 2 billion users in over 200 countries. So very\nhappy with this development. But when it comes specifically to the\nmonetization of it, we talked about it before. We see monetization at\napproximately the same rate, which gives us actually a really strong base\non which we can then innovate and drive actually a more innovative and new\nand next-generation ad formats. That's how we look at it at this moment in\ntime.\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nOn the second part, with respect to OpenAI, look, we are very excited to be\npartnering with them on Google Cloud. Google Cloud is an open platform, and\nwe have a strong history of supporting great companies, startups, AI labs,\net cetera. So super excited about our partnership there on the cloud side\nand we look forward to investing more in that relationship and growing in\nthere.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore.\n\nMark Stephen F. Mahaney\nEvercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division\n\nOkay. Two questions, please. First, could you just describe maybe Philipp,\nwhat you see in terms of the ad environment maybe for the back half of the\nyear maybe versus last year? Does it seem as certain or as uncertain as it\nwas last year, the results seemed pretty strong. Are there any unusual\nconcerns you would have for the back half of the year? And then, Sundar, I\nwant to ask you again about the 2 surfaces approach to Search.\n\nAnd you obviously got some -- you must have some internal metrics that\nwould tell you that that's the optimal way for you to approach the market.\nBut there's -- I'm sure there's a counterargument that just having that\nunified search and being able to discern the intent of the search, whether\nit's pure information or commercial, just from the query that, that could\ngive you a material advantage over other offerings in the market. Just talk\na little bit about what metrics you've seen that make it -- that make the\ntwo surface solutions seem to be optimal.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\nSenior Vice President & Chief Business Officer of Google\n\nSo let me start. Look, we said our ad business performed strongly in Q2.\nGive you maybe some vertical color of it in Q2, Search and other\nperformance was led by growth across all verticals. We mentioned the\nlargest contributions from retail and financial services, which was\nprimarily due actually to strength in insurance. We saw health care as a\nsizable contributor to growth as well. Look, we're only a few weeks into\nQ3. So I think it's really too early to comment on anything happened in the\nsecond half of the year.\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nAnd Mark, second part of the question. Look, I think between these 2\nsurfaces, you're pretty much covering the entire breadth and depth of what\nhumanity can possibly do. So I think the split for 2 surfaces to tackle at\nthis moment. Obviously, you are right, Search is more information focused.\nAnd we think of the Gemini app as more your assistant, more personal,\nproactive and powerful assistant for every aspect of your daily life. And\nso you can imagine wanting to call deeply or create a long video, et\ncetera, like those things can be done by the Gemini app today better.\n\nOver time, like we've always done, we've gone through these evolutions\nbefore, like, as you point out, we can understand user intent better and\nabstract some of the complexity for our users. At one point, people used to\ngo to -- query separately for text, differently from images, definitely\nfrom videos, et cetera, and we kind of made it all seamless with Universal\nSearch.\n\nSo we have the experience of being able to bring together experiences in a\nway that makes sense for users and do the heavy lifting for them. But I\nthink when you're in this early stage of new emerging paradigms, I think we\nwant to make sure we can meet them where they -- what they are expecting\ntoday. And over time, I think it will give us an opportunity to serve them\nbetter. So I think that's how we are thinking about it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo.\n\nKenneth James Gawrelski\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\n\nTwo, if I may, please. The first on Cloud, I'm just hoping maybe you could\nclarify your back half outlook. Given last quarter, you talked about some\nsupply constraints that would ease towards the end of 2025, but yet you put\nup a really nice acceleration in 2Q. Now you're talking about some supply\nconstraints easing into '26. If you could just clarify a little bit on the\nback half outlook for cloud given the strong results in 2Q?\n\nAnd then the second is a bigger picture question, which is, in agentic\nexperience, does it democratize the web like Search did 2 decades ago,\nenabling discovery in the long tail? Or does it lead to more concentration\nwith a smaller group of vertical winners? Would love if you could opine on\nthat.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nOkay. On your first question on the cloud second half outlook and the\ncomments I previously made on with regards to where we're going to see the\ncapacity increase. So obviously, we're working hard to bring more capacity\nonline, which means data centers and servers that are coming online. And we\nsee more of an increase towards the back end of the year. But we're\nincreasing capacity with every quarter that goes by, as you can see with\nthe growth rates we've had both this quarter and the previous quarter.\n\nAs Sundar mentioned earlier, this is not the type of investment that's a\nlight switch. It takes time to make this investment. So what you're seeing\nnow is investment we made some time ago, that's now translating to\nadditional capacity coming online, but more of that towards the back end of\nthe year. I will say, it's important as you think about cloud growth, not\nto think about this in a linear fashion, because the quarter-on-quarter\ngrowth rates could depend on the timing of capacity delivery and when that\ncomes online, so that could move a little bit from quarter-to-quarter.\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nOn agentic experience. Look, I think there was an earlier question on the\ntechnology aspects of it and how we are making progress. Obviously, there\nis the value proposition for all the players involved. And I think that's\ngoing to be an equally important thing to create the unlock here. And I do\nthink over time, users will it's clear to me as we make progress on the\nagentic experience, it's going to be a much better experience for users,\nright? And so you'll find savvier players leaning into these experiences,\nand that will help them grow and meet this moment.\n\nAnd I think -- so I do think it's an opportunity for some of the players.\nAnd so you are right, just like the early days of the web, there are\naspects about it, which will expand access, grow the use cases, et cetera.\nAnd I think that elements are there. But I do think it's important. It's\nnot just a technology play, but we have to solve the business models for\nvarying players involved. So I think that's going to be an important part\nof this evolution as well.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our last question comes from Justin Post with BAML.\n\nJustin Post\nBofA Securities, Research Division\n\nA couple for Sundar. First, it looks like the subscription businesses are\nall tracking well. And certainly, Gemini 2.5 has got some much good\nreviews. How are you doing with Gemini subscriptions. I know it's a focus\narea for the company. And anything you can kind of do to accelerate the\nconsumer subscriptions of Gemini within Google One. And then secondly, just\non the course change of CapEx, obviously, a bigger increase, which appears\nto be because of cloud demand. But just your comments on cloud ROI and I'm\nsorry, CapEx ROI. What gives you confidence that you're going to get good\nreturns on that spend?\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nGreat. On the first thing on subscriptions, we definitely -- Google One has\nbeen an attractive value proposition powered by storage. But with now our\nAI plans, including both Pro and Ultra and particularly with the 2.5 series\nof models, we have definitely seen accelerated traction. So it was a very\nhealthy quarter. And so we are definitely excited about the opportunities\nahead. And you will find through this moment, I think, we'll be able to\ndrive growth in that area based on our AI offerings. And so it's definitely\nan area we are both excited by, and we are actually seeing traction,\nparticularly in the last quarter ever since we introduced 2.5 Pro. So we\nare excited about the trajectory there.\n\nOn the CapEx on the cloud side, look, I think, we are definitely investing\nbecause we are delivering a lot of value through our cloud offerings. And I\nthink it's important to understand as we build more and more of an\ninstalled base with Google Cloud. We have very high customer satisfaction.\nOur churn rates are very low, and we are much more efficient in the\ninvestments needed to grow those lines of businesses.\n\nSo you're seeing all that play out in our margin trajectory, particularly\nif you look at it annually sequentially over the past few years. And so all\nthat gives us confidence as we are investing in this, we'll be able to have\na healthy ROI on our investments. And particularly in this AI moment,\nthere's definitely -- the value we are delivering to the customers is also\ngrowing pretty significantly on a forward-looking basis. And so I think all\nthat will help us do well here.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to\nturn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any for the remarks.\n\nJames Friedland\n\nThanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with\nyou again on our third quarter 2025 call. Thank you, and have a good\nevening.\n\nOperatorThank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call.

  "presentation_text": "Operator\n\nWelcome, everyone. Thank you for standing by for the Alphabet Second\nQuarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\n\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim\nFriedland, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Friedland\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's Second\nQuarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Sundar Pichai,\nPhilipp Schindler, and Anat Ashkenazi.\n\nNow I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make\ntoday regarding our business, operations and financial performance may be\nconsidered forward-looking. Such statements are based on current\nexpectations and assumptions that are subject to a number of risks and\nuncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Please refer to our\nForms 10-K and 10-Q, including the risk factors. We undertake no obligation\nto update any forward-looking statement.\n\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial\nmeasures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in\ntoday's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the\npublic through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.\nOur comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state\notherwise. And now I'll turn the call over to Sundar.\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was a standout quarter for us\nwith robust growth across the company. As you saw at IO, we are leading at\nthe frontier of AI and shipping at an incredible pace. AI is positively\nimpacting every part of the business, driving strong momentum.\n\nThis quarter, Search delivered double-digit revenue growth. Our new Search\nfeatures continue to perform well. AI Mode has launched in the U.S. and\nIndia and is going well, while AI Overviews now has over 2 billion monthly\nusers across more than 200 countries and territories and 40 languages. I'll\ngive some more details on Search in a moment.\n\nWe continue to see strong performance in YouTube as well as subscriptions,\nreflecting great momentum across these high-growth businesses. In the U.S.,\nshorts now earn as much revenue per watch hour as traditional in-stream on\nYouTube. And in some countries, it now even exceeds in-stream's rate. Cloud\nhad another great quarter of strong growth in revenues, backlog and\nprofitability. Its annual revenue run rate is now more than $50 billion. We\nare seeing significant demand for our comprehensive AI product portfolio.\n\nOf course, this is all possible because of the long-term investments we\nhave made in our differentiated full stack approach to AI. This spans AI\ninfrastructure, world-class research, models and tooling and our products\nand platforms that brings AI to people all over the world. I'll briefly\ntouch on the AI stack before turning to quarterly highlights.\n\nFirst, AI infrastructure. We operate the leading global network of AI-\noptimized data centers and cloud regions. We also offer the industry's\nwidest range of TPUs and GPUs along with storage and software built on top.\nThat's why nearly all GenAI unicorns use Google Cloud. And that's why a\ngrowing number, including leading AI research labs like Safe\nSuperintelligence and Physical Intelligence use TPU specifically. Our AI\ninfrastructure investments are crucial to meeting the growth in demand from\ncloud customers.\n\nNext, world-class AI research, including models and tooling. We continue to\nexpand our Gemini 2.5 family of hybrid reasoning models, which provide\nindustry-leading performance in nearly every major benchmark. In addition\nto improving our popular workhorse model Flash, we debuted an extremely\nfast flashlight version. We achieved gold medal level performance in the\nInternational Math Olympiad using an advanced version of Gemini with\nDeepting. We can't wait to bring Deepting to users soon. We have some of\nthe best models available today at every price point. Our 2.5 models have\nbeen a catalyst for growth and 9 million developers have now built with\nGemini.\n\nI also want to mention Veo 3, our state-of-the-art video generation model.\nIt's been a viral hit with people sharing clips created in the Gemini app\nand with our new AI filmmaking tool Flow. Since May, over 70 million videos\nhave been generated using Veo 3. And we recently introduced a feature in\nthe Gemini app to turn photos into videos, which people absolutely love.\nIt's also rolling out to Google Photos users starting today. Third, our\nproducts and platforms. We are bringing AI to all our users and partners\nthrough surfaces like Workspace, Chrome and more. The growth in usage has\nbeen incredible. At IO in May, we announced that we processed 480 trillion\nmonthly tokens across our surfaces. Since then, we have doubled that\nnumber, now processing over 980 trillion monthly tokens, a remarkable\nincrease.\n\nThe Gemini app now has more than 450 million monthly active users, and we\ncontinue to see strong growth in engagement with daily requests growing\nover 50% from Q1. In June alone, over 50 million people used AI-powered\nmeeting notes in Google Meet. And powered by Veo 3, our new short video\nproduct in Workspace called Google Vids reached nearly 1 million monthly\nactive users. This month at Samsung Galaxy Unpacked, we announced new\nAndroid and AI features that are available on Samsung's latest devices. And\nwe are really pleased with the growth in subscriptions, which got a boost\nfrom our Google AI Pro and Ultra plans.\n\nNow some key highlights from Search, Cloud, YouTube and Waymo for the\nquarter. First up, this is an incredibly exciting moment for Search. We see\nAI powering an expansion in how people are searching for and accessing\ninformation, unlocking completely new kinds of questions you can ask\nGoogle. Overall queries and commercial queries on Search continue to grow\nyear-over-year. And our new AI experiences significantly contributed to\nthis increase in usage. We are also seeing that our AI features cause users\nto search more as they learn that search can meet more of their needs.\nThat's especially true for younger users.\n\nLet me go deeper on our new search experiences. We know how popular AI\nOverviews are because they are now driving over 10% more queries globally\nfor the types of queries that show them, and this growth continues to\nincrease over time. AI Overviews are now powered by Gemini 2.5, delivering\nthe fastest AI responses in the industry. We also saw strong growth in the\nuse of multimodal search, particularly the combination of lens or Circle to\nSearch together with AI overviews. This growth was most pronounced among\nyounger users.\n\nOur new end-to-end AI search experience, AI Mode continues to receive very\npositive feedback, particularly for longer and more complex questions. It's\nstill rolling out, but already has over 100 million monthly active users in\nthe U.S. and India. We plan to keep enhancing the AI Mode experience for\nusers by shipping great features fast. That includes our advanced research\ntool Deep Search and more personalized responses.\n\nNext, Google Cloud. We see strong customer demand, driven by our product\ndifferentiation and our comprehensive AI product portfolio. Four stats show\nthis. One, the number of deals over $250 million, doubling year-over-year;\ntwo, in the first half of 2025, we signed the same number of deals over $1\nbillion that we did in all of 2024. Three, the number of new GCP customers\nincreased by nearly 28% quarter-over-quarter; four, more than 85,000\nenterprises, including LVMH, Salesforce and Singapore's DBS Bank now build\nwith Gemini, driving a 35x growth in Gemini usage year-over-year.\n\nOur models have served on our AI infrastructure, which offers industry-\nleading performance and cost efficiency for both training and inference.\nAlong with our AI accelerators, we introduced new innovations in storage,\nincluding Anywhere Cache, which improves inference latency by up to 70% and\nrapid storage, which delivers a 5x improvement in latency compared to\nleading hyperscalers. In addition, we have optimized AI software packages,\nincluding PyTorch and JAX with full open source supports for various AI\ntraining and serving demands.\n\nWe've also integrated AI agents deeply into each of our cloud products.\nWayfair is leveraging our databases integrated with AI to streamline data\npipelines and deliver more personalized customer experiences. Vantel is\nleveraging our Gemini-powered data agents and BigQuery to review and act on\nproduct feedback more quickly. Target is using our Gemini-powered threat\nintelligence and security operations agents to improve cybersecurity.\nCapgemini is utilizing our AI software engineering agents to deliver higher-\nquality software faster by automating tasks from code generation to\ntesting. And BBVA says Gemini and Google Workspace is saving employees\nnearly 3 hours per week by automating repetitive tasks. It's now rolling it\nout to 100,000 employees globally.\n\nWe are also focused on building a flourishing AI agent ecosystem. We\nintroduced an open source agent development kit, which now has over 1\nmillion downloads in less than 4 months. We also introduced Agentspace, an\nopen and interoperable enterprise chat search and agent platform. Gordon\nFood Service is bringing Agentspace to its U.S. employees, which is\nenabling better, more efficient decision-making. And over 1 million\nsubscriptions have been booked for Agentspace ahead of its general\navailability.\n\nTurning now to YouTube. Nielsen data shows YouTube has led U.S. streaming\nwatch time for over 2 years. A generation that grew up with YouTube on\ntheir devices is now increasingly watching their favorite creators and\ncontent on their televisions. That includes billions of sports fans, too.\nGlobally, they consume more than 40 billion hours of sports content on\nYouTube annually. And in September, we'll stream the NFL's first Friday\ngame of the season, live from Brazil.\n\nFrom sports to shorts, we now average over 200 billion daily views on\nYouTube Shorts. AI is helping improve our recommendations and auto dubbing,\nwhich translates to better returns for creators and brands by dramatically\nincreasing the potential audiences they can reach. And today, we began\nrolling out a whole draft of new AI tools for creators on YouTube Shorts.\n\nFinally, YouTube continues to diversify its subscription options, recently\nexpanding its premium light offerings to 15 new countries with more to\ncome. And lastly, Waymo continues to scale and expand to safely serve more\nriders in more places. Last month, Waymo launched in Atlanta, more than\ndoubled its Austin service territory and expanded its Los Angeles and San\nFrancisco Bay Area territories by approximately 50%. Waymo also launched\nteen accounts, starting with riders aged 14 to 17 in Phoenix. Overall,\ngreat momentum here. The Waymo driver has now autonomously driven over 100\nmillion miles on public roads. And the team is testing across more than 10\ncities this year, including New York and Philadelphia. We hope to serve\nriders in all 10 in the future.\n\nAs I said, a standout quarter. A big thank you, as always, to our employees\nand partners for an amazing Q2. Philipp, over to you.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\nSenior Vice President & Chief Business Officer of Google\n\nThanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. I'll quickly cover performance for\nGoogle Services for the quarter, then structure the rest of my remarks\naround the great progress we're delivering across search, ads, YouTube and\npartnerships. Google Services revenues were $83 billion for the quarter, up\n12% year-on-year, driven by strong growth in Search and YouTube, partially\noffset by year-on-year decline in network revenues.\n\nTo add some further color to our results. The 12% increase in Search and\nother revenues was led by growth across all verticals with the largest\ncontributions from retail and financial services. YouTube saw similar\nperformance across verticals. It's 13% growth in advertising revenues was\ndriven by direct response followed by brand. Starting with search and other\nrevenues, which delivered over $54 billion in revenue for the quarter.\nShifts like AI are what propels our industry forward. Gemini's native\nmultimodality is helping bring the offline audio and visual world back into\nthe online world, creating a number of opportunities for Search. Let me\nshare a few examples.\n\nTake visual queries. Google Lens search is one of the fastest-growing query\ntypes on Search and grew 70% since this time last year. Majority of lens\nsearches are incremental, and we're seeing healthy growth for shopping\nqueries using lens. And you can obviously take this to the next level by\nmoving from image to video-based capabilities like Search Live. And then\nthere's Circle to Search, which is now in over 300 million Android devices.\nWe've been adding capabilities to help people explore complex topics and\nask follow-up questions without switching apps. For example, gamers can now\nuse Circle to Search while playing mobile games to see an AI overview or\nanswers. And just last week, we brought in new agentic capability directly\ninto search for all U.S. users with AI-powered calling to local businesses.\n\nFinally, shopping, where in Q2, we introduced a virtual trial experience\nfor search labs users in the U.S. Now people can try billions of clothing\nproducts on themselves virtually. Early results and engagement have been\nextremely positive, particularly with Gen Z users and we'll be bringing\nthis functionality to all U.S. users imminently.\n\nAll these innovations are opening up completely new ways for people to use\ntechnology, bringing the off-line world into the online world in ways that\nsimply have not been possible before. Add in our amazing AI translation\ncapabilities and just imagine the possibilities. People can access more\ncontent in the language and businesses, large and small, international or\nlocal can reach even more customers. I'm excited about how all of these\nelements will come together and the opportunities ahead of us in Search.\n\nMoving to ads where our strategy to reinvent the entire marketing process\nwith AI is delivering value for our customers and our business. Last\nquarter, we introduced AI Max and Search, a new suite of AI-powered\nfeatures in existing search campaigns. Advertisers that activate AI Max and\nSearch campaigns typically see 14% more conversions. On media buying, Smart\nBidding Exploration, the biggest update to bidding strategy in a decade\nbrings better performance to advertisers by allowing them to bid on a less\nobvious but potentially higher value queries more often.\n\nCampaigns using Smart Bidding Exploration, see a 19% increase in\nconversions on average. Demand gen continues to drive revenue growth and\ndeliver measurable impact for our customers. As an example, Depop, Etsy's\nresell clothing marketplace used a short only demand gen campaign to drive\nnew customers to the site. Short drove 80% buyer brand load and double\nclick-through rates versus benchmarks. On creatives, we launched Asset\nStudio using our latest models to help businesses, large and small,\ngenerate creative assets. Small businesses benefit from top quality assets\nand deployment scaling capabilities, but larger businesses can go faster\nfrom proof of concept to launch and resize at lower cost. Over 2 million\nadvertisers now use Google's AI powered asset generation tools to run ads,\na 50% increase on this time last year.\n\nTurning to YouTube, where we saw continued strong revenue growth driven by\ndirect response followed by brand. YouTube creators are connected to the\nglobal site guys and trusted by their audiences like no others. As part of\nBrand Connect, we launched Creator partnership hub, which allows brands to\nmore easily work with the right creators and tap into cultural moments. We\nintroduced Veo 3, photo to video and generative effects to shorts, making\ncontent creation easier and offering unexplored avenues for creativity.\nWe're seeing both the volume and the price of ads and shorts increase,\nparticularly in developed markets. The feed-based nature of the product\nallows for more ad opportunities on average, and this growth is further\nsupported by ad formats native to shorts, AI-powered ad creative resizing\ntools, improved ad targeting and the rise in viewer engagement.\n\nMcDonald's U.S.A. harnessed the influence of YouTube creators to ignite\nawareness for the Minecraft movie meal. It leveraged YouTube Shorts\npartnership adds to increase its reach, generating a 3.3x higher view\nthrough rate than the industry benchmark.\n\nFinally, on CTV where the momentum continues. According to the gauge report\nby Nielsen, YouTube has been #1 in streaming watch time in the U.S. for\nmore than 2 years, hitting a record high of 12.8% of total TV viewing in\nJune 2025. In the past 12 months, YouTube ads viewed on CTV screens drove\nover 1 billion conversions. We saw strong growth in retail thanks to CTV\nshopping ads, which allows viewers to shop directly via QR codes, helping\nus leverage direct marketing opportunities. As always, I'll wrap up with\nthe momentum we're seeing in partnerships, where our customers increasingly\nrecognize the strength and breadth of Google's ability to help them\ntransform their business with AI.\n\nFor instance, a new partnership with PayPal will improve the digital\ncommerce experience for their merchants and customers. PayPal will expand\nits Google Cloud adoption for AI-driven recommendations, transaction\nprocessing and enhanced security. The partnership also broadens the\navailability and functionality of PayPal's payment services and\ncapabilities across a range of Google products.\n\nIn closing, I'd like to thank Googlers everywhere for their contributions\nand commitment to our success and to our customers and partners for their\ncontinued trust. Anat, over to you.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Philipp. My comments will focus on year-over-year comparisons\nfor the second quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with the\nresults at the Alphabet level and will then cover our segment results. I'll\nend with some commentary on our outlook for the second half of 2025. We had\nanother solid quarter in Q2. Consolidated revenue of $96.4 billion\nincreased by 14% or 13% in constant currency.\n\nSearch and YouTube advertising, subscription platforms and devices and\nGoogle Cloud each had double-digit revenue growth this quarter reflecting\nstrong momentum across the business. Total cost of revenue was $39 billion,\nup 10%. Tech was $14.7 billion, up 10%; and other cost of revenue was $24.3\nbillion, up 10%, with the increase primarily driven by content acquisition\ncosts, largely for YouTube, followed by depreciation. Total operating\nexpenses increased 20% to $26.1 billion. The biggest driver of growth was\nexpense for legal and other matters, which reflected the impact of $1.4\nbillion charge related to a settlement in principle of certain legal\nmatters.\n\nR&D investments increased by 16%, primarily driven by increases in\ncompensation and depreciation expenses. Sales and marketing expenses\nincreased 5%, primarily reflecting an increase in advertising and\npromotional expenses. Operating income increased 14% this quarter to $31.3\nbillion and operating margin was 32.4%. Operating margin benefited from\nstrong revenue growth and continued efficiencies in our expense base,\npartially offset by the legal charge I mentioned earlier, and a significant\nincrease in depreciation expense. Net income increased 19% to $28.2\nbillion, and earnings per share increased 22% to $2.31.\n\nWe generated free cash flow of $5.3 billion in the second quarter and $66.7\nbillion for the trailing 12 months. Free cash flow in the second quarter\nwas affected by a sizable sequential increase in CapEx and cash tax\npayments as we make federal tax payments in the second quarter for both Q1\nand Q2. We ended the quarter with $95 billion in cash and marketable\nsecurities.\n\nTurning to segment results. Google Services revenues increased 12% to $82.5\nbillion reflecting strength in Google Search and YouTube advertising and\nsubscriptions.\n\nGoogle Search and other revenues increased by 12% to $54.2 billion. Search\nand other revenues delivered growth across all verticals with the largest\ncontributions coming from retail and financial services. YouTube\nadvertising revenues increased 13% to $9.8 billion, driven by direct\nresponse advertising, followed by brand. Network advertising revenue of\n$7.4 billion were down 1%.\n\nSubscription platforms and devices revenues increased 20% to $11.2 billion,\nprimarily reflecting growth in subscription revenues. This growth was\ndriven by YouTube subscription offerings followed by Google One, with the\ngrowth in paid subscriptions being the biggest driver of revenue growth.\nGoogle Services operating income increased 11% to $33.1 billion.\n\nOperating margin was flat year-on-year at 40.1% as healthy revenue growth\nand continued efficiency in our expense base were partially offset by the\nlegal charge I mentioned earlier. Turning to the Google Cloud segment,\nwhich delivered very strong results this quarter. Revenues increased by 32%\nto $13.6 billion in the second quarter, reflecting growth in GCP across\ncore and AI products at the rate that was much higher than cloud's overall\nrevenue growth and growth in Google Workspace, driven by an increase in\naverage revenue per seat and the number of seats.\n\nGoogle Cloud operating income increased to $2.8 billion, and operating\nmargin increased from 11.3% to 20.7%. The expansion in cloud operating\nmargin was driven by strong revenue performance and continued efficiencies\nin our expense base partially offset by higher technical infrastructure\nusage costs, which includes the associated depreciation. As we ramp our AI\ninvestments, we continue to focus on driving improvements in productivity\nand efficiency to offset growth in technical infrastructure-related\nexpenses, particularly from higher depreciation. Google Cloud backlog\nincreased 18% sequentially in Q2 and 38% year-over-year, reaching $106\nbillion at the end of the quarter.\n\nThis growth was driven by strong demand for our products and services from\nboth new and existing customers. As Sundar mentioned, we have signed\nmultiple billion dollar plus deals in the first half of the year. As to our\nOther Bets in the second quarter, revenue were $373 million, and operating\nloss was $1.2 billion. Within Other Bets, we're allocating more resources\nto businesses like Waymo, where we see opportunities to create additional\nvalue. With respect to CapEx in the second quarter, our CapEx was $22.4\nbillion. The vast majority of our CapEx was invested in technical\ninfrastructure with approximately 2/3 of investments in servers and 1/3 in\ndata centers and networking equipment. In Q2, we returned capital to\nshareholders through repurchase of stock of $13.6 billion and dividend\npayments of $2.5 billion.\n\nTurning to our outlook. I would like to provide some commentary on several\nfactors that will impact our business performance in the second half of\n2025 as well as an updated outlook for full year CapEx. First, in terms of\nrevenues, we're pleased with the overall momentum we're seeing across the\nbusiness. At current spot rates, we could see a tailwind to our revenue in\nQ3. However, volatility in exchange rates could affect the impact of FX on\nQ3 revenue. As for our segments in Google Services, advertising revenues in\nthe second half of 2025 will be affected by the following: The continued\nlapping of the strength we experienced in financial service verticals\nthroughout 2024 and year-over-year comparisons will be negatively impacted\nby the strong spend on U.S. Election in the second half of 2024 and\nparticularly on YouTube.\n\nIn Cloud, as I mentioned, the demand for our products is high as evidenced\nby the continued revenue growth and the cloud backlog of $106 billion.\nWhile we have been working hard to increase capacity and have improved the\npace of server deployment, we expect to remain in a tight demand supply\nenvironment going into 2026.\n\nMoving to investments. Given the strong demand for our cloud products and\nservices, we now expect to invest approximately $85 billion in CapEx in\n2025, up from a previous estimate of $75 billion.\n\nOur updated outlook reflects additional investment in servers, the timing\nof delivery of servers and an acceleration in the pace of data center\nconstruction, primarily to meet cloud customer demand. Looking out to 2026,\nwe expect a further increase in CapEx due to the demand we're seeing from\ncustomers as well as growth opportunities across the company. We will\nprovide more details on the 2026 CapEx outlook on a future earnings call.\nIn terms of expenses, first, as I mentioned in our previous earnings call,\nthe significant increase in our investments in CapEx over the past few\nyears will continue to put pressure on the P&L, primarily in the form of\nhigher depreciation.\n\nIn the second quarter, depreciation increased $1.3 billion year-over-year\nto $5 billion, reflecting a growth rate of 35%. Given the recent increase\nin CapEx investments, we expect the growth rate and depreciation to\naccelerate further in Q3. Second, as we've previously said, we expect some\nheadcount growth in 2025 in key investment areas. In the third quarter, we\nexpect a sequential increase in total headcount additions due in part to\nthe hiring of new graduates.\n\nAnd third, Q3 will reflect the expense associated with the upcoming August\nlaunch of the new Pixel family of products. In conclusion, as you heard\nfrom Sundar and Philipp, we're pleased with the momentum in the business\nand excited about the pace of innovation. Our full stack approach, which\ncombines AI infrastructure, AI research and AI products and platforms\nposition us well to deliver new products and services across the company.\nWe're seeing great momentum with our efforts as demonstrated by the\nincrease in cumulative token processed. Search revenues are seeing healthy\ngrowth with features like AI Overviews, AI Mode and Lens, offering new ways\nfor users to access the information.\n\nCloud has reached an annual revenue run rate of more than $50 billion and\nis delivering margin expansion while continue to invest to meet customer\ndemand. And YouTube has expanded its addressable market by building new\nservices like shorts which now averages over 200 billion daily views. We're\nexcited to see the value our products and services are bringing to\ncustomers and partners around the globe.\nNow I'll turn it over to the operator, and Sundar and Philipp and I will\ntake your questions.",
  "qa_text": "Operator\n\n[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Eric Sheridan with\nGoldman Sachs.\n\nEric James Sheridan\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\n\nMaybe one for Sundar and one for Philipp. Sundar, when you think about the\njourney you're on with respect to the evolution of products and platforms.\nHow do you think about some of the implications of changed consumer\nbehavior and how investors should think about that from the volume\nperspective versus the monetization perspective. So I think there's a lot\nof long-standing dynamics out there about clicks and click monetization\nthat might be very different when you look out over the next 3 to 5 years.\n\nAnd Philipp, when you think about the evolution of YouTube, you made a\nnumber of comments there about subscription revenue. I'm just curious how\nyou think about the mix of advertising versus subscription? And what some\nof your key learnings might have been as the subscription side of the\nbusiness continues to scale?\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Eric. I appreciate the question. I don't think looking ahead, based\non everything we are seeing, it's -- people are excited about AI. They are\nadopting it well across our products. For me just in multimodality how\npeople have modified their behavior to include images, both through Lens\nand Circle to Search seamlessly as part of interacting with Google are\nearly indications that people are going to be adopting through these\nmoments very, very well.\n\nI think I'm trying to understand your question in terms of about clicks and\nclick monetization, maybe that's something Philipp can touch on. But\noverall, we expect as we build out our organic experiences. We have a good\nunderstanding of how to continue training on monetization, so that will\nwork well with organic experiences. And -- but we will lead with the\norganic experience.\n\nSo in terms of newer surfaces like Gemini app, et cetera, we'll focus on\nthe organic experience for the near term. But just like we are doing with\nAI Overviews and with AI Mode over time, we'll be able to bring very, very\ngood commercial experiences there as well. And we think people will adapt\nto them as they've always done. Maybe Philipp can add more. Philipp?\n\nPhilipp Schindler\nSenior Vice President & Chief Business Officer of Google\n\nYes. So on your question on YouTube subscriptions versus ads, look, I mean\nwe love our ads business. We love our subscription business. YouTube\nsubscriptions are increasingly important for YouTube. We'll definitely\ncontinue our long-term focus here. We had a strong growth across the\nYouTube subscription products, which includes, just to be clear, YouTube\nTV, YouTube Music and Premium. And I think one common theme for our\nsubscription services in general is offering viewers more choice here. We\nalso have a very deep understanding of the monetization side here. Where\nare we monetizing more with ads, where can we potentially monetize more\nwith subscriptions. So I think we will continue this as a double tier\nstrategy actively going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\n\nDouglas Till Anmuth\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nOne for Sundar and one for Philipp. Sundar, can you just talk about how\nyou're thinking about your current access to compute even as you spend $10\nbillion more this year in CapEx, you also said that you're still in a tight\nsupply environment. So just trying to marry those?\n\nAnd then Philipp, perhaps on search growth, can you talk a little bit about\nPayclick and pricing growth just within the 12% search growth? And how we\nshould think about volume versus monetization trends going forward?\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nDoug, on the CapEx stuff, obviously, we are seeing strong momentum across\nour portfolio and especially in cloud. You are right. It's a tight supply\nenvironment. And we are investing more to expand, but there is obviously a\ntime delay between this additional investment will play out in future\nyears. And so that's why both of them are true at the same time. And -- but\nwe are planning ahead, and we are investing and -- but overall, it's\nexciting to see the traction, particularly in cloud. I think the\ncomprehensiveness of our AI portfolio breadth of our offerings, both\nproviding our models on GPUs and TPUs for our customers. All of that has\nbeen really driving demand. And so we are investing to match up to it.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\nSenior Vice President & Chief Business Officer of Google\n\nAnd on your paid click question, look, to be very clear, I think we said\nthis before, we manage the business to drive great outcomes for our users\nand an attractive ROI for our advertisers. We actually don't manage to pay\nclicks and CPC targets. Some of the product and policy changes we make\nactually drive better monetization at the expense of paid clicks. You will\nactually see in the 10-Q, pay clicks were up 4% year-on-year. But a number\nof factors affect these metrics from quarter-to-quarter, such as a few\nexamples, advertiser spending, product changes, policy changes, user\nengagement and so on. So it's really important when it comes to pay clicks\nand CPCs to avoid drawing like overly broad conclusions solely based on\nthese metrics.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\n\nBrian Thomas Nowak\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\n\nI have two. First one, Sundar, there's a lot of discussion about agentic\nsearch for commercial activities and agents that can be broadly deployed.\nMaybe could you just -- from a technology perspective, when you sit down\nwith the engineering teams working on some of these new agentic\ncapabilities that could come, what are some of the predominant\ntechnological hurdles they think need to be cleared in order to launch\nscalable agents for commercial queries, is the first one. And second one, I\nthink in the past, you've updated us on stats on sources of internal\nefficiency you've seen from GenAI-enabled capabilities. Any updates there?\nAnd then any sort of learnings on friction points that also need to be\novercome for some of these internal tools for GenAI?\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nLet me start with the first one on agentic capabilities. Look, overall, we\nare definitely, in many ways when we built 2.5 -- our series of 2.5 models,\nparticularly with Pro, et cetera. It's the direction where we are investing\nthe most. There's definitely exciting progress, including in the models we\nhaven't fully released yet. And the main gaps we're all trying to do is\nyou're obviously chaining a sequence of events. And so being able to do it\nreliably the latency compounds, the cost compounds and being able to do it\nreliably in a way for the users all of this comes together.\n\nIn each of this, we are making progress, and it all needs to kind of hang\ntogether. The good news is we are making robust progress. We think we are\nat the frontier there. And in all of these areas, when you look back on a\n12-month basis, you end up making the models much more efficient for any\ngiven capability. So the forward-looking trajectory, I think, will really\nunlock these agentic experiences. We see the potential being able to do\nthem, but they're a bit slow and costly and takes time, and sometimes are\nbrittle, right? But they're making progress on all of that. And I think\nthat's what will really unlock. And I expect 2026 to be the year in which\npeople kind of use agentic experiences more broadly, right? And so it's an\nexciting opportunity ahead.\n\nOn the second part, I think, when you say a source of generalization, I\npresume you're talking about how we are using all of this internally.\nAgain, given you've asked a question about agents, we are now beginning to\nroll out agentic coding journeys for our software engineers within the\ncompany. And it's been exciting to see just over the last few months,\nparticularly over the last few weeks, people are definitely doing more\nagentic workflows and software engineering as well internally.\n\nAnd that's a good example of the kind of the same experiences a few months\nago, had a lot of friction points, but we are overcoming it and people are\nbeginning to use internally on the coding side as well as in certain other\nareas of the company as well. So exciting progress. I expect it to be an\nactive area where we will roll out journeys for our users as well. So look\nforward to it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.\n\nMichael Brian Nathanson\nMoffettNathanson LLC\n\nSundar, I have two for you. At IO, you announced a partnership to Warby\nParker to develop glasses. So I wonder if you show your view of how\nimportant a cycle of new devices will be to further scale AI and do you\nenvision a world in which the more functional are essential to our consumer\nexperience. That's one. And secondly, how does Google Search with AI Mode\nusage different -- differs, sorry, versus Gemini stand-alone apps. So I'm\nwondering, are you seeing any differences in usage or the types of\nconsumers who go to the app versus who go to traditional search with AI?\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nOn the first thing, look, I think any time IO changes, you can drive new\nexperiences, including on hardware experiences too. So I think AI will\nparticularly enable. You long had the promise of glasses and other form\nfactors. But I think AI will spur a whole new wave of innovation there. We\nare super excited about our investment in glasses and found the experiences\nhave taken a dramatic step-up compared to the last iteration.\n\nSo I think it's been an exciting new emerging category, but I still expect\nphones to be at the center of the experience for the next 2 to 3 years at\nleast. And so I still think that's going to be phones, would continue to be\nat the center of the consumer experience. But we are excited about the\nemerging categories as well.\n\nOn your second question on AI Mode versus Gemini stand-alone app, broadly,\nthere are some use cases where you can get a great experience in both\nplaces, but there are use cases which are very specific. I think where the\nqueries are information-oriented but people really want to rely on the\ninformation, but I have the full power of AI. I think AI mode really shines\nin that. You can go there, and you know it's backed up. The Gemini models\nare using search deeply as a tool. And so it's on grounded in that search\nexperience. And I think users are responding very positively to it. And\nwhereas the Gemini stand-alone app, you see everything from -- people can\nhave a long conversation of chat just trying to pass time, right, in the\nGemini app.\n\nYou've seen early cases where people may get into it in a therapy like\nexperience, right? So these are all emerging experiences of what people do.\nAnd I think this is why I'm glad we have both surfaces and we can innovate\nin both of these areas. And of course, there will be areas which will be\ncommonly served by both applications. And over time, I think we can make\nexperience more seamless for our users.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Mark Shmulik with Bernstein.\n\nMark Elliott Shmulik\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\n\nSundar, it seems there's almost like a daily news report about the AI\ntalent war and high-profile folks moving around which is kind of like your\nperspective on how you think Google has been doing it both kind of\nattracting and retaining key AI talent. And Anat, along the similar lines,\nhow do we think about AI-related resourcing costs alongside kind of the\nstep up in capital investments required to go build for AI?\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nMark, on the first question, look, I think, we've gone through these\nmoments before. We've obviously always deeply invested in talent, including\nan AI talent for well over a decade now. And I think we have an\nextraordinary both breadth and depth of the talent. In my experience, the\ntop people look for a combination of they want to really be at the frontier\ndriving progress. And so the mission and how state-of-the-art, your workers\nmatter. So that's super important to them, access to compute resources and\naccess to your peers, right.\n\nWorking with the best people in the industry, and it's a combination of all\nof that and using it to drive impact. And I think we are pretty competitive\non all those fronts. And through this moment, we continue to -- I look at\nthe -- both our retention metrics as well as the new talent coming in and\nboth are healthy. I do know individual cases can make headlines, but when\nwe look at numbers deeply, I think we are doing very well through this\nmoment and we'll continue investing in the people and the talent and the\ncompute needed to make sure we are set up for the opportunity ahead. And\nmaybe I'll pass it on to Anat.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nYes, on the question on how we integrate this into our overall cost\nstructure. And I've mentioned before, having the benefit of having the full\nstack includes research, which is our people and one of our most critical\nresource. So we make sure that we invest appropriately to have the best and\nbrightest minds in the industry sitting here at Google and advancing our\ninnovation to customers. It is part of what you're seeing now in our\noperating expense line across the organization.\n\nBut we're also working hard to offset not just growth in investment across\nthe business. But also to ensure that we can allocate research\nappropriately. So Sundar mentioned earlier, the use of AI tools within the\ncompany. So that's another area where we can drive efficiency across the\nbusinesses to use these tools internally in terms of how we run the\norganization. Then we're continuing on the same efforts that I've talked\nabout before with regards to running the company with a high level of\ndiscipline, execution and driving efficiency across the business.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays.\n\nRoss Adam Sandler\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\n\nGreat. If I can ask two, that would be great. So the first one is on Search\nclick-through rates as a driver of monetization. So you guys have done a\ngreat job over the past decade of driving better ad relevancy and higher\nclick-through rates in Search. Just curious, as we look forward and we see\nlower ad impressions per SERP and all these things that are changing with\nAI overviews and different AI SERP formats. How do you feel about your\nability to drive CTR going forward? And then the second question is, it\nlooks like you're now working with OpenAI for some aspect of cloud\ninfrastructure. Just curious how that relationship might expand in the\nfuture?\n\nPhilipp Schindler\nSenior Vice President & Chief Business Officer of Google\n\nI can make the first one. Look, specifically referring to AI Overviews, if\nI understood your question correctly, as Sundar mentioned it, they continue\nto drive higher satisfaction. They continue to drive higher search usage.\nThey're scaling up very nicely and they're actually working for our entire\nuser base now scaled to over 2 billion users in over 200 countries. So very\nhappy with this development. But when it comes specifically to the\nmonetization of it, we talked about it before. We see monetization at\napproximately the same rate, which gives us actually a really strong base\non which we can then innovate and drive actually a more innovative and new\nand next-generation ad formats. That's how we look at it at this moment in\ntime.\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nOn the second part, with respect to OpenAI, look, we are very excited to be\npartnering with them on Google Cloud. Google Cloud is an open platform, and\nwe have a strong history of supporting great companies, startups, AI labs,\net cetera. So super excited about our partnership there on the cloud side\nand we look forward to investing more in that relationship and growing in\nthere.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore.\n\nMark Stephen F. Mahaney\nEvercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division\n\nOkay. Two questions, please. First, could you just describe maybe Philipp,\nwhat you see in terms of the ad environment maybe for the back half of the\nyear maybe versus last year? Does it seem as certain or as uncertain as it\nwas last year, the results seemed pretty strong. Are there any unusual\nconcerns you would have for the back half of the year? And then, Sundar, I\nwant to ask you again about the 2 surfaces approach to Search.\n\nAnd you obviously got some -- you must have some internal metrics that\nwould tell you that that's the optimal way for you to approach the market.\nBut there's -- I'm sure there's a counterargument that just having that\nunified search and being able to discern the intent of the search, whether\nit's pure information or commercial, just from the query that, that could\ngive you a material advantage over other offerings in the market. Just talk\na little bit about what metrics you've seen that make it -- that make the\ntwo surface solutions seem to be optimal.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\nSenior Vice President & Chief Business Officer of Google\n\nSo let me start. Look, we said our ad business performed strongly in Q2.\nGive you maybe some vertical color of it in Q2, Search and other\nperformance was led by growth across all verticals. We mentioned the\nlargest contributions from retail and financial services, which was\nprimarily due actually to strength in insurance. We saw health care as a\nsizable contributor to growth as well. Look, we're only a few weeks into\nQ3. So I think it's really too early to comment on anything happened in the\nsecond half of the year.\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nAnd Mark, second part of the question. Look, I think between these 2\nsurfaces, you're pretty much covering the entire breadth and depth of what\nhumanity can possibly do. So I think the split for 2 surfaces to tackle at\nthis moment. Obviously, you are right, Search is more information focused.\nAnd we think of the Gemini app as more your assistant, more personal,\nproactive and powerful assistant for every aspect of your daily life. And\nso you can imagine wanting to call deeply or create a long video, et\ncetera, like those things can be done by the Gemini app today better.\n\nOver time, like we've always done, we've gone through these evolutions\nbefore, like, as you point out, we can understand user intent better and\nabstract some of the complexity for our users. At one point, people used to\ngo to -- query separately for text, differently from images, definitely\nfrom videos, et cetera, and we kind of made it all seamless with Universal\nSearch.\n\nSo we have the experience of being able to bring together experiences in a\nway that makes sense for users and do the heavy lifting for them. But I\nthink when you're in this early stage of new emerging paradigms, I think we\nwant to make sure we can meet them where they -- what they are expecting\ntoday. And over time, I think it will give us an opportunity to serve them\nbetter. So I think that's how we are thinking about it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo.\n\nKenneth James Gawrelski\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\n\nTwo, if I may, please. The first on Cloud, I'm just hoping maybe you could\nclarify your back half outlook. Given last quarter, you talked about some\nsupply constraints that would ease towards the end of 2025, but yet you put\nup a really nice acceleration in 2Q. Now you're talking about some supply\nconstraints easing into '26. If you could just clarify a little bit on the\nback half outlook for cloud given the strong results in 2Q?\n\nAnd then the second is a bigger picture question, which is, in agentic\nexperience, does it democratize the web like Search did 2 decades ago,\nenabling discovery in the long tail? Or does it lead to more concentration\nwith a smaller group of vertical winners? Would love if you could opine on\nthat.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nOkay. On your first question on the cloud second half outlook and the\ncomments I previously made on with regards to where we're going to see the\ncapacity increase. So obviously, we're working hard to bring more capacity\nonline, which means data centers and servers that are coming online. And we\nsee more of an increase towards the back end of the year. But we're\nincreasing capacity with every quarter that goes by, as you can see with\nthe growth rates we've had both this quarter and the previous quarter.\n\nAs Sundar mentioned earlier, this is not the type of investment that's a\nlight switch. It takes time to make this investment. So what you're seeing\nnow is investment we made some time ago, that's now translating to\nadditional capacity coming online, but more of that towards the back end of\nthe year. I will say, it's important as you think about cloud growth, not\nto think about this in a linear fashion, because the quarter-on-quarter\ngrowth rates could depend on the timing of capacity delivery and when that\ncomes online, so that could move a little bit from quarter-to-quarter.\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nOn agentic experience. Look, I think there was an earlier question on the\ntechnology aspects of it and how we are making progress. Obviously, there\nis the value proposition for all the players involved. And I think that's\ngoing to be an equally important thing to create the unlock here. And I do\nthink over time, users will it's clear to me as we make progress on the\nagentic experience, it's going to be a much better experience for users,\nright? And so you'll find savvier players leaning into these experiences,\nand that will help them grow and meet this moment.\n\nAnd I think -- so I do think it's an opportunity for some of the players.\nAnd so you are right, just like the early days of the web, there are\naspects about it, which will expand access, grow the use cases, et cetera.\nAnd I think that elements are there. But I do think it's important. It's\nnot just a technology play, but we have to solve the business models for\nvarying players involved. So I think that's going to be an important part\nof this evolution as well.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our last question comes from Justin Post with BAML.\n\nJustin Post\nBofA Securities, Research Division\n\nA couple for Sundar. First, it looks like the subscription businesses are\nall tracking well. And certainly, Gemini 2.5 has got some much good\nreviews. How are you doing with Gemini subscriptions. I know it's a focus\narea for the company. And anything you can kind of do to accelerate the\nconsumer subscriptions of Gemini within Google One. And then secondly, just\non the course change of CapEx, obviously, a bigger increase, which appears\nto be because of cloud demand. But just your comments on cloud ROI and I'm\nsorry, CapEx ROI. What gives you confidence that you're going to get good\nreturns on that spend?\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nGreat. On the first thing on subscriptions, we definitely -- Google One has\nbeen an attractive value proposition powered by storage. But with now our\nAI plans, including both Pro and Ultra and particularly with the 2.5 series\nof models, we have definitely seen accelerated traction. So it was a very\nhealthy quarter. And so we are definitely excited about the opportunities\nahead. And you will find through this moment, I think, we'll be able to\ndrive growth in that area based on our AI offerings. And so it's definitely\nan area we are both excited by, and we are actually seeing traction,\nparticularly in the last quarter ever since we introduced 2.5 Pro. So we\nare excited about the trajectory there.\n\nOn the CapEx on the cloud side, look, I think, we are definitely investing\nbecause we are delivering a lot of value through our cloud offerings. And I\nthink it's important to understand as we build more and more of an\ninstalled base with Google Cloud. We have very high customer satisfaction.\nOur churn rates are very low, and we are much more efficient in the\ninvestments needed to grow those lines of businesses.\n\nSo you're seeing all that play out in our margin trajectory, particularly\nif you look at it annually sequentially over the past few years. And so all\nthat gives us confidence as we are investing in this, we'll be able to have\na healthy ROI on our investments. And particularly in this AI moment,\nthere's definitely -- the value we are delivering to the customers is also\ngrowing pretty significantly on a forward-looking basis. And so I think all\nthat will help us do well here.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to\nturn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any for the remarks.\n\nJames Friedland\n\nThanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with\nyou again on our third quarter 2025 call. Thank you, and have a good\nevening.\n\nOperatorThank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call.

      "text": "CEO & Director Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was a standout quarter for us with robust growth across the company. As you saw at IO, we are leading at the frontier of AI and shipping at an incredible pace. AI is positively impacting every part of the business, driving strong momentum. This quarter, Search delivered double-digit revenue growth. Our new Search features continue to perform well. AI Mode has launched in the U.S. and India and is going well, while AI Overviews now has over 2 billion monthly users across more than 200 countries and territories and 40 languages. I'll give some more details on Search in a moment. We continue to see strong performance in YouTube as well as subscriptions, reflecting great momentum across these high-growth businesses. In the U.S., shorts now earn as much revenue per watch hour as traditional in-stream on YouTube. And in some countries, it now even exceeds in-stream's rate. Cloud had another great quarter of strong growth in revenues, backlog and profitability. Its annual revenue run rate is now more than $50 billion. We are seeing significant demand for our comprehensive AI product portfolio. Of course, this is all possible because of the long-term investments we have made in our differentiated full stack approach to AI. This spans AI infrastructure, world-class research, models and tooling and our products and platforms that brings AI to people all over the world. I'll briefly touch on the AI stack before turning to quarterly highlights. First, AI infrastructure. We operate the leading global network of AI- optimized data centers and cloud regions. We also offer the industry's widest range of TPUs and GPUs along with storage and software built on top. That's why nearly all GenAI unicorns use Google Cloud. And that's why a growing number, including leading AI research labs like Safe Superintelligence and Physical Intelligence use TPU specifically. Our AI infrastructure investments are crucial to meeting the growth in demand from cloud customers. Next, world-class AI research, including models and tooling. We continue to expand our Gemini 2.5 family of hybrid reasoning models, which provide industry-leading performance in nearly every major benchmark. In addition to improving our popular workhorse model Flash, we debuted an extremely fast flashlight version. We achieved gold medal level performance in the International Math Olympiad using an advanced version of Gemini with Deepting. We can't wait to bring Deepting to users soon. We have some of the best models available today at every price point. Our 2.5 models have been a catalyst for growth and 9 million developers have now built with Gemini. I also want to mention Veo 3, our state-of-the-art video generation model. It's been a viral hit with people sharing clips created in the Gemini app and with our new AI filmmaking tool Flow. Since May, over 70 million videos have been generated using Veo 3. And we recently introduced a feature in the Gemini app to turn photos into videos, which people absolutely love. It's also rolling out to Google Photos users starting today. Third, our products and platforms. We are bringing AI to all our users and partners through surfaces like Workspace, Chrome and more. The growth in usage has been incredible. At IO in May, we announced that we processed 480 trillion monthly tokens across our surfaces. Since then, we have doubled that number, now processing over 980 trillion monthly tokens, a remarkable increase. The Gemini app now has more than 450 million monthly active users, and we continue to see strong growth in engagement with daily requests growing over 50% from Q1. In June alone, over 50 million people used AI-powered meeting notes in Google Meet. And powered by Veo 3, our new short video product in Workspace called Google Vids reached nearly 1 million monthly active users. This month at Samsung Galaxy Unpacked, we announced new Android and AI features that are available on Samsung's latest devices. And we are really pleased with the growth in subscriptions, which got a boost from our Google AI Pro and Ultra plans. Now some key highlights from Search, Cloud, YouTube and Waymo for the quarter. First up, this is an incredibly exciting moment for Search. We see AI powering an expansion in how people are searching for and accessing information, unlocking completely new kinds of questions you can ask Google. Overall queries and commercial queries on Search continue to grow year-over-year. And our new AI experiences significantly contributed to this increase in usage. We are also seeing that our AI features cause users to search more as they learn that search can meet more of their needs. That's especially true for younger users. Let me go deeper on our new search experiences. We know how popular AI Overviews are because they are now driving over 10% more queries globally for the types of queries that show them, and this growth continues to increase over time. AI Overviews are now powered by Gemini 2.5, delivering the fastest AI responses in the industry. We also saw strong growth in the use of multimodal search, particularly the combination of lens or Circle to Search together with AI overviews. This growth was most pronounced among younger users. Our new end-to-end AI search experience, AI Mode continues to receive very positive feedback, particularly for longer and more complex questions. It's still rolling out, but already has over 100 million monthly active users in the U.S. and India. We plan to keep enhancing the AI Mode experience for users by shipping great features fast. That includes our advanced research tool Deep Search and more personalized responses. Next, Google Cloud. We see strong customer demand, driven by our product differentiation and our comprehensive AI product portfolio. Four stats show this. One, the number of deals over $250 million, doubling year-over-year; two, in the first half of 2025, we signed the same number of deals over $1 billion that we did in all of 2024. Three, the number of new GCP customers increased by nearly 28% quarter-over-quarter; four, more than 85,000 enterprises, including LVMH, Salesforce and Singapore's DBS Bank now build with Gemini, driving a 35x growth in Gemini usage year-over-year. Our models have served on our AI infrastructure, which offers industry- leading performance and cost efficiency for both training and inference. Along with our AI accelerators, we introduced new innovations in storage, including Anywhere Cache, which improves inference latency by up to 70% and rapid storage, which delivers a 5x improvement in latency compared to leading hyperscalers. In addition, we have optimized AI software packages, including PyTorch and JAX with full open source supports for various AI training and serving demands. We've also integrated AI agents deeply into each of our cloud products. Wayfair is leveraging our databases integrated with AI to streamline data pipelines and deliver more personalized customer experiences. Vantel is leveraging our Gemini-powered data agents and BigQuery to review and act on product feedback more quickly. Target is using our Gemini-powered threat intelligence and security operations agents to improve cybersecurity. Capgemini is utilizing our AI software engineering agents to deliver higher- quality software faster by automating tasks from code generation to testing. And BBVA says Gemini and Google Workspace is saving employees nearly 3 hours per week by automating repetitive tasks. It's now rolling it out to 100,000 employees globally. We are also focused on building a flourishing AI agent ecosystem. We introduced an open source agent development kit, which now has over 1 million downloads in less than 4 months. We also introduced Agentspace, an open and interoperable enterprise chat search and agent platform. Gordon Food Service is bringing Agentspace to its U.S. employees, which is enabling better, more efficient decision-making. And over 1 million subscriptions have been booked for Agentspace ahead of its general availability. Turning now to YouTube. Nielsen data shows YouTube has led U.S. streaming watch time for over 2 years. A generation that grew up with YouTube on their devices is now increasingly watching their favorite creators and content on their televisions. That includes billions of sports fans, too. Globally, they consume more than 40 billion hours of sports content on YouTube annually. And in September, we'll stream the NFL's first Friday game of the season, live from Brazil. From sports to shorts, we now average over 200 billion daily views on YouTube Shorts. AI is helping improve our recommendations and auto dubbing, which translates to better returns for creators and brands by dramatically increasing the potential audiences they can reach. And today, we began rolling out a whole draft of new AI tools for creators on YouTube Shorts. Finally, YouTube continues to diversify its subscription options, recently expanding its premium light offerings to 15 new countries with more to come. And lastly, Waymo continues to scale and expand to safely serve more riders in more places. Last month, Waymo launched in Atlanta, more than doubled its Austin service territory and expanded its Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay Area territories by approximately 50%. Waymo also launched teen accounts, starting with riders aged 14 to 17 in Phoenix. Overall, great momentum here. The Waymo driver has now autonomously driven over 100 million miles on public roads. And the team is testing across more than 10 cities this year, including New York and Philadelphia. We hope to serve riders in all 10 in the future. As I said, a standout quarter. A big thank you, as always, to our employees and partners for an amazing Q2. Philipp, over to you.",

      "text": "Senior Vice President & Chief Business Officer of Google Thanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. I'll quickly cover performance for Google Services for the quarter, then structure the rest of my remarks around the great progress we're delivering across search, ads, YouTube and partnerships. Google Services revenues were $83 billion for the quarter, up 12% year-on-year, driven by strong growth in Search and YouTube, partially offset by year-on-year decline in network revenues. To add some further color to our results. The 12% increase in Search and other revenues was led by growth across all verticals with the largest contributions from retail and financial services. YouTube saw similar performance across verticals. It's 13% growth in advertising revenues was driven by direct response followed by brand. Starting with search and other revenues, which delivered over $54 billion in revenue for the quarter. Shifts like AI are what propels our industry forward. Gemini's native multimodality is helping bring the offline audio and visual world back into the online world, creating a number of opportunities for Search. Let me share a few examples. Take visual queries. Google Lens search is one of the fastest-growing query types on Search and grew 70% since this time last year. Majority of lens searches are incremental, and we're seeing healthy growth for shopping queries using lens. And you can obviously take this to the next level by moving from image to video-based capabilities like Search Live. And then there's Circle to Search, which is now in over 300 million Android devices. We've been adding capabilities to help people explore complex topics and ask follow-up questions without switching apps. For example, gamers can now use Circle to Search while playing mobile games to see an AI overview or answers. And just last week, we brought in new agentic capability directly into search for all U.S. users with AI-powered calling to local businesses. Finally, shopping, where in Q2, we introduced a virtual trial experience for search labs users in the U.S. Now people can try billions of clothing products on themselves virtually. Early results and engagement have been extremely positive, particularly with Gen Z users and we'll be bringing this functionality to all U.S. users imminently. All these innovations are opening up completely new ways for people to use technology, bringing the off-line world into the online world in ways that simply have not been possible before. Add in our amazing AI translation capabilities and just imagine the possibilities. People can access more content in the language and businesses, large and small, international or local can reach even more customers. I'm excited about how all of these elements will come together and the opportunities ahead of us in Search. Moving to ads where our strategy to reinvent the entire marketing process with AI is delivering value for our customers and our business. Last quarter, we introduced AI Max and Search, a new suite of AI-powered features in existing search campaigns. Advertisers that activate AI Max and Search campaigns typically see 14% more conversions. On media buying, Smart Bidding Exploration, the biggest update to bidding strategy in a decade brings better performance to advertisers by allowing them to bid on a less obvious but potentially higher value queries more often. Campaigns using Smart Bidding Exploration, see a 19% increase in conversions on average. Demand gen continues to drive revenue growth and deliver measurable impact for our customers. As an example, Depop, Etsy's resell clothing marketplace used a short only demand gen campaign to drive new customers to the site. Short drove 80% buyer brand load and double click-through rates versus benchmarks. On creatives, we launched Asset Studio using our latest models to help businesses, large and small, generate creative assets. Small businesses benefit from top quality assets and deployment scaling capabilities, but larger businesses can go faster from proof of concept to launch and resize at lower cost. Over 2 million advertisers now use Google's AI powered asset generation tools to run ads, a 50% increase on this time last year. Turning to YouTube, where we saw continued strong revenue growth driven by direct response followed by brand. YouTube creators are connected to the global site guys and trusted by their audiences like no others. As part of Brand Connect, we launched Creator partnership hub, which allows brands to more easily work with the right creators and tap into cultural moments. We introduced Veo 3, photo to video and generative effects to shorts, making content creation easier and offering unexplored avenues for creativity. We're seeing both the volume and the price of ads and shorts increase, particularly in developed markets. The feed-based nature of the product allows for more ad opportunities on average, and this growth is further supported by ad formats native to shorts, AI-powered ad creative resizing tools, improved ad targeting and the rise in viewer engagement. McDonald's U.S.A. harnessed the influence of YouTube creators to ignite awareness for the Minecraft movie meal. It leveraged YouTube Shorts partnership adds to increase its reach, generating a 3.3x higher view through rate than the industry benchmark. Finally, on CTV where the momentum continues. According to the gauge report by Nielsen, YouTube has been #1 in streaming watch time in the U.S. for more than 2 years, hitting a record high of 12.8% of total TV viewing in June 2025. In the past 12 months, YouTube ads viewed on CTV screens drove over 1 billion conversions. We saw strong growth in retail thanks to CTV shopping ads, which allows viewers to shop directly via QR codes, helping us leverage direct marketing opportunities. As always, I'll wrap up with the momentum we're seeing in partnerships, where our customers increasingly recognize the strength and breadth of Google's ability to help them transform their business with AI. For instance, a new partnership with PayPal will improve the digital commerce experience for their merchants and customers.

      "text": "Senior VP & CFO Thank you, Philipp. My comments will focus on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with the results at the Alphabet level and will then cover our segment results. I'll end with some commentary on our outlook for the second half of 2025. We had another solid quarter in Q2. Consolidated revenue of $96.4 billion increased by 14% or 13% in constant currency. Search and YouTube advertising, subscription platforms and devices and Google Cloud each had double-digit revenue growth this quarter reflecting strong momentum across the business. Total cost of revenue was $39 billion, up 10%. Tech was $14.7 billion, up 10%; and other cost of revenue was $24.3 billion, up 10%, with the increase primarily driven by content acquisition costs, largely for YouTube, followed by depreciation. Total operating expenses increased 20% to $26.1 billion. The biggest driver of growth was expense for legal and other matters, which reflected the impact of $1.4 billion charge related to a settlement in principle of certain legal matters. R&D investments increased by 16%, primarily driven by increases in compensation and depreciation expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased 5%, primarily reflecting an increase in advertising and promotional expenses. Operating income increased 14% this quarter to $31.3 billion and operating margin was 32.4%. Operating margin benefited from strong revenue growth and continued efficiencies in our expense base, partially offset by the legal charge I mentioned earlier, and a significant increase in depreciation expense. Net income increased 19% to $28.2 billion, and earnings per share increased 22% to $2.31. We generated free cash flow of $5.3 billion in the second quarter and $66.7 billion for the trailing 12 months. Free cash flow in the second quarter was affected by a sizable sequential increase in CapEx and cash tax payments as we make federal tax payments in the second quarter for both Q1 and Q2. We ended the quarter with $95 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results. Google Services revenues increased 12% to $82.5 billion reflecting strength in Google Search and YouTube advertising and subscriptions. Google Search and other revenues increased by 12% to $54.2 billion. Search and other revenues delivered growth across all verticals with the largest contributions coming from retail and financial services. YouTube advertising revenues increased 13% to $9.8 billion, driven by direct response advertising, followed by brand. Network advertising revenue of $7.4 billion were down 1%. Subscription platforms and devices revenues increased 20% to $11.2 billion, primarily reflecting growth in subscription revenues. This growth was driven by YouTube subscription offerings followed by Google One, with the growth in paid subscriptions being the biggest driver of revenue growth. Google Services operating income increased 11% to $33.1 billion. Operating margin was flat year-on-year at 40.1% as healthy revenue growth and continued efficiency in our expense base were partially offset by the legal charge I mentioned earlier. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, which delivered very strong results this quarter. Revenues increased by 32% to $13.6 billion in the second quarter, reflecting growth in GCP across core and AI products at the rate that was much higher than cloud's overall revenue growth and growth in Google Workspace, driven by an increase in average revenue per seat and the number of seats. Google Cloud operating income increased to $2.8 billion, and operating margin increased from 11.3% to 20.7%. The expansion in cloud operating margin was driven by strong revenue performance and continued efficiencies in our expense base partially offset by higher technical infrastructure usage costs, which includes the associated depreciation. As we ramp our AI investments, we continue to focus on driving improvements in productivity and efficiency to offset growth in technical infrastructure-related expenses, particularly from higher depreciation. Google Cloud backlog increased 18% sequentially in Q2 and 38% year-over-year, reaching $106 billion at the end of the quarter. This growth was driven by strong demand for our products and services from both new and existing customers. As Sundar mentioned, we have signed multiple billion dollar plus deals in the first half of the year. As to our Other Bets in the second quarter, revenue were $373 million, and operating loss was $1.2 billion. Within Other Bets, we're allocating more resources to businesses like Waymo, where we see opportunities to create additional value. With respect to CapEx in the second quarter, our CapEx was $22.4 billion. The vast majority of our CapEx was invested in technical infrastructure with approximately 2/3 of investments in servers and 1/3 in data centers and networking equipment. In Q2, we returned capital to shareholders through repurchase of stock of $13.6 billion and dividend payments of $2.5 billion. Turning to our outlook. I would like to provide some commentary on several factors that will impact our business performance in the second half of 2025 as well as an updated outlook for full year CapEx. First, in terms of revenues, we're pleased with the overall momentum we're seeing across the business. At current spot rates, we could see a tailwind to our revenue in Q3. However, volatility in exchange rates could affect the impact of FX on Q3 revenue. As for our segments in Google Services, advertising revenues in the second half of 2025 will be affected by the following: The continued lapping of the strength we experienced in financial service verticals throughout 2024 and year-over-year comparisons will be negatively impacted by the strong spend on U.S. Election in the second half of 2024 and particularly on YouTube. In Cloud, as I mentioned, the demand for our products is high as evidenced by the continued revenue growth and the cloud backlog of $106 billion. While we have been working hard to increase capacity and have improved the pace of server deployment, we expect to remain in a tight demand supply environment going into 2026. Moving to investments. Given the strong demand for our cloud products and services, we now expect to invest approximately $85 billion in CapEx in 2025, up from a previous estimate of $75 billion. Our updated outlook reflects additional investment in servers, the timing of delivery of servers and an acceleration in the pace of data center construction, primarily to meet cloud customer demand. Looking out to 2026, we expect a further increase in CapEx due to the demand we're seeing from customers as well as growth opportunities across the company. We will provide more details on the 2026 CapEx outlook on a future earnings call. In terms of expenses, first, as I mentioned in our previous earnings call, the significant increase in our investments in CapEx over the past few years will continue to put pressure on the P&L, primarily in the form of higher depreciation. In the second quarter, depreciation increased $1.3 billion year-over-year to $5 billion, reflecting a growth rate of 35%. Given the recent increase in CapEx investments, we expect the growth rate and depreciation to accelerate further in Q3. Second, as we've previously said, we expect some headcount growth in 2025 in key investment areas. In the third quarter, we expect a sequential increase in total headcount additions due in part to the hiring of new graduates. And third, Q3 will reflect the expense associated with the upcoming August launch of the new Pixel family of products. In conclusion, as you heard from Sundar and Philipp, we're pleased with the momentum in the business and excited about the pace of innovation. Our full stack approach, which combines AI infrastructure, AI research and AI products and platforms position us well to deliver new products and services across the company. We're seeing great momentum with our efforts as demonstrated by the increase in cumulative token processed. Search revenues are seeing healthy growth with features like AI Overviews, AI Mode and Lens, offering new ways for users to access the information. Cloud has reached an annual revenue run rate of more than $50 billion and is delivering margin expansion while continue to invest to meet customer demand. And YouTube has expanded its addressable market by building new services like shorts which now averages over 200 billion daily views. We're excited to see the value our products and services are bringing to customers and partners around the globe. Now I'll turn it over to the operator, and Sundar and Philipp and I will take your questions. Question and Answer",

How do you think about some of the implications of changed consumer behavior and how investors should think about that from the volume perspective versus the monetization perspective. So I think there's a lot of long-standing dynamics out there about clicks and click monetization that might be very different when you look out over the next 3 to 5 years. And Philipp, when you think about the evolution of YouTube, you made a number of comments there about subscription revenue. I'm just curious how you think about the mix of advertising versus subscription? And what some of your key learnings might have been as the subscription side of the business continues to scale?",

They are adopting it well across our products. For me just in multimodality how people have modified their behavior to include images, both through Lens and Circle to Search seamlessly as part of interacting with Google are early indications that people are going to be adopting through these moments very, very well. I think I'm trying to understand your question in terms of about clicks and click monetization, maybe that's something Philipp can touch on. But overall, we expect as we build out our organic experiences. We have a good understanding of how to continue training on monetization, so that will work well with organic experiences. And -- but we will lead with the organic experience. So in terms of newer surfaces like Gemini app, et cetera, we'll focus on the organic experience for the near term. But just like we are doing with AI Overviews and with AI Mode over time, we'll be able to bring very, very good commercial experiences there as well.

We love our subscription business. YouTube subscriptions are increasingly important for YouTube. We'll definitely continue our long-term focus here. We had a strong growth across the YouTube subscription products, which includes, just to be clear, YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium. And I think one common theme for our subscription services in general is offering viewers more choice here. We also have a very deep understanding of the monetization side here. Where are we monetizing more with ads, where can we potentially monetize more with subscriptions. So I think we will continue this as a double tier strategy actively going forward.",

We actually don't manage to pay clicks and CPC targets. Some of the product and policy changes we make actually drive better monetization at the expense of paid clicks. You will actually see in the 10-Q, pay clicks were up 4% year-on-year. But a number of factors affect these metrics from quarter-to-quarter, such as a few examples, advertiser spending, product changes, policy changes, user engagement and so on. So it's really important when it comes to pay clicks and CPCs to avoid drawing like overly broad conclusions solely based on these metrics.",

Maybe could you just -- from a technology perspective, when you sit down with the engineering teams working on some of these new agentic capabilities that could come, what are some of the predominant technological hurdles they think need to be cleared in order to launch scalable agents for commercial queries, is the first one. And second one, I think in the past, you've updated us on stats on sources of internal efficiency you've seen from GenAI-enabled capabilities. Any updates there? And then any sort of learnings on friction points that also need to be overcome for some of these internal tools for GenAI?",

    {
      "speaker": "Sundar  Pichai",
      "role": "CEO & Director",
      "text": "CEO & Director Let me start with the first one on agentic capabilities. Look, overall, we are definitely, in many ways when we built 2.5 -- our series of 2.5 models, particularly with Pro, et cetera. It's the direction where we are investing the most. There's definitely exciting progress, including in the models we haven't fully released yet. And the main gaps we're all trying to do is you're obviously chaining a sequence of events. And so being able to do it reliably the latency compounds, the cost compounds and being able to do it reliably in a way for the users all of this comes together. In each of this, we are making progress, and it all needs to kind of hang together. The good news is we are making robust progress. We think we are at the frontier there. And in all of these areas, when you look back on a 12-month basis, you end up making the models much more efficient for any given capability. So the forward-looking trajectory, I think, will really unlock these agentic experiences. We see the potential being able to do them, but they're a bit slow and costly and takes time, and sometimes are brittle, right? But they're making progress on all of that. And I think that's what will really unlock. And I expect 2026 to be the year in which people kind of use agentic experiences more broadly, right? And so it's an exciting opportunity ahead. On the second part, I think, when you say a source of generalization, I presume you're talking about how we are using all of this internally. Again, given you've asked a question about agents, we are now beginning to roll out agentic coding journeys for our software engineers within the company. And it's been exciting to see just over the last few months, particularly over the last few weeks, people are definitely doing more agentic workflows and software engineering as well internally. And that's a good example of the kind of the same experiences a few months ago, had a lot of friction points, but we are overcoming it and people are beginning to use internally on the coding side as well as in certain other areas of the company as well. So exciting progress. I expect it to be an active area where we will roll out journeys for our users as well. So look forward to it.",

At IO, you announced a partnership to Warby Parker to develop glasses. So I wonder if you show your view of how important a cycle of new devices will be to further scale AI and do you envision a world in which the more functional are essential to our consumer experience. That's one. And secondly, how does Google Search with AI Mode usage different -- differs, sorry, versus Gemini stand-alone apps. So I'm wondering, are you seeing any differences in usage or the types of consumers who go to the app versus who go to traditional search with AI?",

You long had the promise of glasses and other form factors. But I think AI will spur a whole new wave of innovation there. We are super excited about our investment in glasses and found the experiences have taken a dramatic step-up compared to the last iteration. So I think it's been an exciting new emerging category, but I still expect phones to be at the center of the experience for the next 2 to 3 years at least. And so I still think that's going to be phones, would continue to be at the center of the consumer experience. But we are excited about the emerging categories as well. On your second question on AI Mode versus Gemini stand-alone app, broadly, there are some use cases where you can get a great experience in both places, but there are use cases which are very specific. I think where the queries are information-oriented but people really want to rely on the information, but I have the full power of AI. I think AI mode really shines in that. You can go there, and you know it's backed up. The Gemini models are using search deeply as a tool. And so it's on grounded in that search experience. And I think users are responding very positively to it. And whereas the Gemini stand-alone app, you see everything from -- people can have a long conversation of chat just trying to pass time, right, in the Gemini app. You've seen early cases where people may get into it in a therapy like experience, right? So these are all emerging experiences of what people do. And I think this is why I'm glad we have both surfaces and we can innovate in both of these areas. And of course, there will be areas which will be commonly served by both applications. And over time, I think we can make experience more seamless for our users.",

But there's -- I'm sure there's a counterargument that just having that unified search and being able to discern the intent of the search, whether it's pure information or commercial, just from the query that, that could give you a material advantage over other offerings in the market.

So I think the split for 2 surfaces to tackle at this moment. Obviously, you are right, Search is more information focused. And we think of the Gemini app as more your assistant, more personal, proactive and powerful assistant for every aspect of your daily life. And so you can imagine wanting to call deeply or create a long video, et cetera, like those things can be done by the Gemini app today better. Over time, like we've always done, we've gone through these evolutions before, like, as you point out, we can understand user intent better and abstract some of the complexity for our users. At one point, people used to go to -- query separately for text, differently from images, definitely from videos, et cetera, and we kind of made it all seamless with Universal Search. So we have the experience of being able to bring together experiences in a way that makes sense for users and do the heavy lifting for them. But I think when you're in this early stage of new emerging paradigms, I think we want to make sure we can meet them where they -- what they are expecting today.

Given last quarter, you talked about some supply constraints that would ease towards the end of 2025, but yet you put up a really nice acceleration in 2Q. Now you're talking about some supply constraints easing into '26. If you could just clarify a little bit on the back half outlook for cloud given the strong results in 2Q? And then the second is a bigger picture question, which is, in agentic experience, does it democratize the web like Search did 2 decades ago, enabling discovery in the long tail? Or does it lead to more concentration with a smaller group of vertical winners? Would love if you could opine on that.",

      "text": "Senior VP & CFO Okay. On your first question on the cloud second half outlook and the comments I previously made on with regards to where we're going to see the capacity increase. So obviously, we're working hard to bring more capacity online, which means data centers and servers that are coming online. And we see more of an increase towards the back end of the year. But we're increasing capacity with every quarter that goes by, as you can see with the growth rates we've had both this quarter and the previous quarter. As Sundar mentioned earlier, this is not the type of investment that's a light switch. It takes time to make this investment. So what you're seeing now is investment we made some time ago, that's now translating to additional capacity coming online, but more of that towards the back end of the year. I will say, it's important as you think about cloud growth, not to think about this in a linear fashion, because the quarter-on-quarter growth rates could depend on the timing of capacity delivery and when that comes online, so that could move a little bit from quarter-to-quarter.",

Obviously, there is the value proposition for all the players involved. And I think that's going to be an equally important thing to create the unlock here. And I do think over time, users will it's clear to me as we make progress on the agentic experience, it's going to be a much better experience for users, right? And so you'll find savvier players leaning into these experiences, and that will help them grow and meet this moment. And I think -- so I do think it's an opportunity for some of the players. And so you are right, just like the early days of the web, there are aspects about it, which will expand access, grow the use cases, et cetera. And I think that elements are there. But I do think it's important. It's not just a technology play, but we have to solve the business models for varying players involved. So I think that's going to be an important part of this evolution as well.",

And certainly, Gemini 2.5 has got some much good reviews. How are you doing with Gemini subscriptions. I know it's a focus area for the company. And anything you can kind of do to accelerate the consumer subscriptions of Gemini within Google One. And then secondly, just on the course change of CapEx, obviously, a bigger increase, which appears to be because of cloud demand. But just your comments on cloud ROI and I'm sorry, CapEx ROI. What gives you confidence that you're going to get good returns on that spend?",

      "text": "CEO & Director Great. On the first thing on subscriptions, we definitely -- Google One has been an attractive value proposition powered by storage. But with now our AI plans, including both Pro and Ultra and particularly with the 2.5 series of models, we have definitely seen accelerated traction. So it was a very healthy quarter. And so we are definitely excited about the opportunities ahead. And you will find through this moment, I think, we'll be able to drive growth in that area based on our AI offerings. And so it's definitely an area we are both excited by, and we are actually seeing traction, particularly in the last quarter ever since we introduced 2.5 Pro. So we are excited about the trajectory there. On the CapEx on the cloud side, look, I think, we are definitely investing because we are delivering a lot of value through our cloud offerings. And I think it's important to understand as we build more and more of an installed base with Google Cloud. We have very high customer satisfaction. Our churn rates are very low, and we are much more efficient in the investments needed to grow those lines of businesses. So you're seeing all that play out in our margin trajectory, particularly if you look at it annually sequentially over the past few years. And so all that gives us confidence as we are investing in this, we'll be able to have a healthy ROI on our investments. And particularly in this AI moment, there's definitely -- the value we are delivering to the customers is also growing pretty significantly on a forward-looking basis. And so I think all that will help us do well here.",
