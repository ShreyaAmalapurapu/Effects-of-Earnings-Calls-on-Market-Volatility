Thanks for joining us. It was a tremendous\nquarter for Alphabet. The launch of Gemini 3 was a major milestone, and we\nhave great momentum. Alphabet annual revenues exceeded $400 billion for the\nfirst time. This quarter, Search continued to accelerate with revenues\ngrowing 17%. YouTube's annual revenues surpassed $60 billion across ads and\nsubscriptions. Cloud significantly accelerated with revenues growing 48%,\nnow on an annual run rate of over $70 billion. Backlog grew by 55% quarter-\nover-quarter to $240 billion, representing a wide breadth of customers\ndriven by demand for AI products. We have over 325 million paid\nsubscriptions across consumer services with strong adoption for Google One\nand YouTube Premium.\n\nIn addition, we have sold more than 8 million paid seats of Gemini\nEnterprise, which we launched just 4 months ago. And our Gemini app now has\nover 750 million monthly active users. We are also seeing significantly\nhigher engagement per user, especially since the launch of Gemini 3 in\nDecember. Overall, we are seeing our AI investments and infrastructure\ndrive revenue and growth across the board. To meet customer demand and\ncapitalize on the growing opportunities ahead of us, our 2026 CapEx\ninvestments are anticipated to be in the range of $175 billion to $185\nbillion. Today, I'll provide an update on our AI progress and then share\nhighlights from Search, Cloud, YouTube and Waymo. First, AI progress across\nthe full stack. Our unrivaled infrastructure serves as the bedrock of our\nAI stack. We have the industry's widest variety of compute options.\n\nThat includes GPUs from our partner, NVIDIA, who announced at CES, that\nwe'll be among the first to offer their latest Vera Rubin GPU platform,\nplus our own TPUs that we have been developing for a decade. In December,\nwe announced our intent to acquire Intersect, which provides data center\nand energy infrastructure solutions. As we scale, we are getting\ndramatically more efficient. We were able to lower Gemini serving unit cost\nby 78% over 2025 through model optimizations, efficiency and utilization\nimprovements. Next, world-class AI research, including models and tooling.\nWe offer the most extensive model portfolio in the world and lead across\ntext, vision and image to video LMArena leaderboards. Gemini 3 Pro drives\nthe state-of-the-art in reasoning and multimodal understanding. It has seen\nthe fastest adoption of any model in our history.\n\nSince launch, Gemini 3 Pro has consistently processed 3x as many daily\ntokens on average as 2.5 Pro. Our latest model powers Google Antigravity,\nour new development platform where agents can autonomously plan and execute\ncomplex software tasks. It already has more than 1.5 million weekly active\nusers after launching just over 2 months ago. Our first-party models like\nGemini now process over 10 billion tokens per minute via direct API used by\nour customers, up from 7 billion last quarter. Third, bringing AI to our\nproducts and platforms. We are shipping innovation at scale to bring\nhelpful AI features to people everywhere. In January alone, we have\nlaunched personal intelligence in AI mode in search and the Gemini app,\nintroduced new features to Gmail an updated view, reimagine Chrome as an AI-\nfirst agentic browser through features like Chrome Auto Browse; announced\nProject Genie, which lets users create and explore interactive worlds\ngenerated in real time using Genie 3, our general purpose world model.\n\nAnd we laid the groundwork for shopping in the AI era by introducing a new\nopen standard for agentic commerce, the universal commerce protocol built\nalongside many retail industry leaders. Finally, from Android to Pixel, we\nare getting our best AI capabilities into people's hands. At CES, a range\nof partners, including Samsung, showcased how they are bringing Gemini to\nmore devices from XR to the living room and beyond. And to confirm the\nrumors, we'll be introducing our Pixel 10a to our best-ever-rated Pixel 10\nseries very soon. Turning now to key highlights from the quarter, starting\nwith search. Search saw more usage in Q4 than ever before as AI continues\nto drive an expansionary moment. We have executed with incredible speed. We\nshipped over 250 product launches within AI Mode and AI Overviews just last\nquarter. We have integrated Gemini 3 directly into AI mode in search.\n\nNow search can better understand your query, dive deeper on the web and\ngenerate interactive UI experiences. And last week, we upgraded AI\nOverviews to Gemini 3, giving users a best-in-class AI response at the top\nof the search results page. We have also made the search experience more\ncohesive, ensuring the transition from an AI overview to a conversation in\nAI mode is completely seamless. These new experiences are proving to be\nmore helpful and are driving greater usage. A few highlights. First, once\npeople start using these new experiences, they use them more. In the U.S.,\nwe saw daily AI Mode queries per user double since launch and AI Overviews\ncontinue to perform very well. Second, people are engaging in longer, more\ncomplex sessions.\n\nQueries in AI Mode are 3x longer than traditional searches. We are also\nseeing sessions become more conversational with a significant portion of\nqueries in AI Mode now leading to a follow-up question. Third, people are\nsearching in new ways beyond text. Nearly 1 in 6 AI Mode queries are now\nnontext using voice or images. And Circle to Search is now available on\nover 580 million Android devices. Next, Google Cloud. Our growth in\nrevenue, operating margin and backlog highlights the strength of our entire\nportfolio. One, we are winning more new customers faster. We exited the\nyear with double the new customer velocity compared to Q1. Two, we are also\nsigning larger customer commitments. The number of deals in 2025, over $1\nbillion surpassed the previous 3 years combined. And three, we continue to\ndeepen our relationships with existing customers who are outpacing their\ninitial commitments by over 30%.\n\nNearly 75% of Google Cloud customers have used our vertically optimized AI\nfrom chips to models to AI platforms and enterprise AI agents, which offer\nsuperior performance, quality, security and cost efficiency. These AI\ncustomers use 1.8x as many products as those who do not, enabling us to\ndiversify our product portfolio, deepen customer relationships and\naccelerate revenue growth. Our product line has multiple monetization\nlevers spanning infrastructure, platform and high-margin AI-powered\nproducts and services with 14 product lines each exceeding $1 billion in\nannual revenue. We offer leading infrastructure for AI training and\ninference to our cloud customers with the industry's widest variety of\ncompute options from our own seventh-generation Ironwood TPU to the latest\nNVIDIA GPUs. Our 10-year track record in building our own accelerators with\nexpertise in chips, systems, networking and software translates to leading\npower and performance efficiency for large-scale inference and training.\n\nOur cloud AI accelerators serve the leading Frontier AI labs, capital\nmarkets firms like Citadel Securities, enterprises like Mercedes-Benz and\ngovernments for high-performance computing applications. We also offer our\nleading generative AI models, including Gemini, Imagen, Veo, Chirp and\nLyria to cloud customers. In December alone, nearly 350 customers each\nprocessed more than 100 billion tokens. In Q4, revenue from products built\non our generative AI models grew nearly 400% year-over-year, significantly\naccelerating from the prior quarter. Today, more than 120,000 enterprises\nuse Gemini, including AI unicorns like Lovable and OpenEvidence and global\nenterprises like Airbus and Honeywell. 95% of the top 20 and over 80% of\nthe top 100 SaaS companies use Gemini, including Salesforce and Shopify.\nGemini is becoming the AI engine for the world's most successful software\ncompanies.\n\nLeading enterprises are also driving strong demand for our enterprise AI\nagents. We have sold more than 8 million paid seats of Gemini Enterprise,\nour enterprise AI platform to more than 2,800 companies, including BNY and\nVirgin Voyages to streamline knowledge management and automate processes.\nGemini Enterprise managed over 5 billion customer interactions in Q4,\ngrowing 65% year-over-year for customers, including Wendy's, Kroger and\nWoolworths Group. Our integration of Gemini and Google Workspace is driving\nwins with global brands like Schwarz Group and public sector organizations\nlike the U.S. Department of Transportation. We are also seeing momentum\nwith independent software vendors. Revenue from AI solutions built by our\npartners increased nearly 300% year-over-year and commitments from our top\n15 software partners grew more than 16x year-over-year.\n\nBefore moving on, I'm pleased that we are collaborating with Apple as their\npreferred cloud provider and to develop the next generation of Apple\nFoundation Models based on Gemini technology. Up next, YouTube. I want to\nhighlight 4 points. First, streaming. In the living room, YouTube continues\nto be the #1 streamer in the U.S. for nearly 3 years according to Nielsen.\nFrom the NFL to Coachella, YouTube is where people watch today's biggest\npopular culture moments unfold. Second, subscriptions. We continue to see\nstrong subscription revenue growth across YouTube, particularly YouTube\nMusic Premium. We'll soon launch new YouTube TV plans, bringing more choice\nand flexibility to subscribers with over 10 genre-specific packages.\n\nAnd the NFL has seen strong NFL Sunday Ticket subscriber growth with\nYouTube, with the highest paid subscriber number ever in the history of the\nproduct. Third, podcasts. To illustrate YouTube's popularity, in October\n2025, viewers watched over 700 million hours of podcasts on living room\ndevices, up 75% from just a year prior. And fourth, AI is transforming the\nYouTube experience for both creators and viewers. On average, every day in\nDecember, over 1 million channels used our new AI creation tools to\nsupercharge their creativity. During that same month, more than 20 million\nviewers used our new Ask tool powered by Gemini to learn more about the\ncontent they watched.\n\nAnd finally, Waymo. This week, Waymo raised its largest investment round to\ndate and is well positioned to continue its momentum with safety at the\ncore. In December, we surpassed 20 million fully autonomous trips and are\nnow providing more than 400,000 rides every week. Waymo continues to expand\nits service territory. Its sixth market, Miami, launched 2 weeks ago, and\nWaymo will soon expand its service to multiple cities across the U.S. and\nin the U.K. and Japan. The team has made incredible progress on important\ncapabilities, including opening up public service to airports and freeways.\nIn closing, 2025 was a fantastic year for the company. A big thanks to our\nemployees and partners worldwide. We are really well positioned going into\n2026. Now over to Philipp.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\nSenior Vice President & Chief Business Officer of Google\n\nThanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. I'll cover performance for Google\nServices for the quarter, then structure the rest of my remarks around the\ngreat progress we're delivering across Search, YouTube and partnerships.\nGoogle Services revenues were $96 billion for the quarter, up 14% year-on-\nyear, primarily driven by accelerated growth in search. Adding some further\ncolor to our results. The 17% increase in search and other was led by broad\nstrength across all major verticals with retail particularly strong. On\nYouTube, the 9% growth in advertising revenues was driven by direct\nresponse. Network advertising revenues were down 2% year-on-year this\nquarter. Starting with search and other revenues, which delivered over $63\nbillion in revenue for the quarter.\n\nSundar mentioned the expansionary moment for search. The same is true for\nads. We're investing in AI to drive significant improvements across all\nareas of marketing. We're expanding the entire playing field that\nadvertisers can compete on. AI gives businesses the ability to reach more\ncustomers in more places than ever before. Gemini uniquely positions us to\nbring the transformational benefits of AI to ads in 3 critical areas for\nour customers: ads quality, advertiser tools and new AI user experiences.\nFirst, ads quality. We've been deploying Gemini models to improve query\nunderstanding at a rate of almost a launch per month for the last 2 years.\nThese improvements drive better query matching, ranking and quality, making\nsearch ads even more effective. With Gemini across our ads quality stack,\nwe evaluate relevance with greater accuracy than with previous generations\nof models.\n\nThis has significantly improved our ability to systematically deliver more\nhelpful high-quality ads, contributing to a meaningful reduction in\nirrelevant ads served. Gemini's understanding of intent has increased our\nability to deliver ads on longer, more complex searches that were\npreviously challenging to monetize. Gemini models also have a significant\nimpact on query understanding in non-English languages, expanding\nopportunities for businesses to scale globally. Second, we're building more\nagentic actions into our advertiser tools. Businesses can now leverage\nGemini in conversational experiences within Ads and Analytics Advisor to\nidentify and run recommended actions such as generating new campaigns.\nAdvertisers use Gemini as a real-time partner to assemble creatives.\n\nIn Q4 alone, they used Gemini to create nearly 70 million creative assets\nvia text customization in AI Max and PMax. For instance, Aritzia, Canada's\npremier fashion house used AI Max to find new high-value customers that\ntraditional strategies miss, delivering an 80% incremental uplift in\nconversion value for Q4. L'Oreal, one of the first alpha testers used AI\nMax in 2025 across 800 unique campaigns in 23 countries and 30 brands. AI\nMax enabled the L'Oreal Group to maximize its presence across the full\nconsumer journey, fuel its consumer growth and increase revenue for DTC\nbrands like NYX by 23%. The third area is how we monetize new AI user\nexperiences in search. We have significantly increased our focus on AI mode\nand are in the early stages of experimenting with AI mode monetization like\ntesting ads below the AI response with more underway.\n\nFor example, we announced Direct Offers, a new Google Ads pilot, which will\nallow advertisers to show exclusive offers for shoppers who are ready to\nbuy directly in AI mode. This new type of sponsored content uses AI to\nmatch the right offer provided by the retailer to the right user. As Sundar\nmentioned, we are building the era of agentic commerce and working with our\npartners to introduce the universal commerce protocol in our consumer\nproducts and across the web. We've received tremendous feedback from the\nindustry. Soon, people can use a new checkout experience to buy directly in\nAI mode in Gemini from select merchants. Turning now to YouTube, which\nremains the #1 streamer in the U.S. for nearly 3 years according to\nNielsen. YouTube creators are providing an unmatched breadth of content.\nOur investment in AI innovation across creativity, viewing experience and\nmonetization continues to pay off.\n\nWe're seeing strong traction in our subscription business, are innovating\nto meet consumers where they are. We added a new sports tier for YouTube TV\nat a lower price point. YouTube Premium Lite is proving to be a popular\nchoice. And we continue to deliver strong year-on-year growth across\nYouTube subscriptions, particularly YouTube Music and Premium. Looking at\nmonetization across YouTube, momentum continues in Shorts in the living\nroom. Shorts now averages over 200 billion daily views. And as we've shared\nbefore, in a number of countries, Shorts earns more revenue per watch hour\nthan traditional in-stream on YouTube, including the U.S. The retail\nvertical continues to grow, fueled by smaller advertisers increasingly\nadopting demand channel. Likewise, direct response continues to benefit\nfrom the momentum we're seeing with small- and medium-sized advertisers.\n\nViewers trust product and brand recommendations from YouTube creators, and\nwe are focused on making YouTube a premier shopping destination.\nInnovations like shoppable ad formats are improving advertiser return on\ninvestment. During Cyber 5, advertisers piloted shoppable mastheads, a new\ninteractive ad format where viewers browse products and send links to their\nphones for an easy shopping experience. On brands, our creator partnership\nhub makes it easier for brands to find creators and develop campaigns. This\nholiday season, brands like JCPenney, Old Navy and Target worked with\ncreators for their holiday campaigns.\n\nMattel partnered with 8 top YouTube creators to reach families during the\npeak holiday shopping season in a campaign that helped drive a 25% increase\nin search volume for UNO. As always, I wrap with the progress we're seeing\nacross partnerships where customers tap into the strength and breadth of\nGoogle's products to accelerate their transformation. I would start by\njoining Sundar in saying how pleased I am that we are collaborating with\nApple as their preferred cloud provider and to develop the next generation\nof Apple Foundation Models based on Gemini technology. We partnered with\nReliance Jio to provide over 500 million consumers with an 18-month free\ntrial of our Gemini suite of products and 2 terabyte of cloud storage.\n\nReliance Enterprise customers will also get access to Google Cloud's Gemini\nEnterprise and TPUs, bringing the best of Google AI to every employee and\nworkflow. The Home Depot is applying Google AI across the board from cloud\ntools to AI-powered ads and YouTube creator partnerships that connect with\nthe next generation off to us. Their investments in PMax and YouTube\ncreator partnerships have resulted in double-digit increase in ad clicks\nand visits. In closing, I'd like to thank Googlers everywhere for their\ncontributions to our success and as always, to our customers and partners\nfor their continued trust. Anat, over to you.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Philipp. My comments will focus on year-over-year comparisons\nfor the fourth quarter, unless I state otherwise. I will start with results\nat the Alphabet level and will then cover segment results. I'll end with\nsome commentary on our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2026.\n2025 was a strong year of innovation and execution for Alphabet. These\nefforts, combined with our investments in AI, drove meaningful results\nacross the business. For the full year 2025, Alphabet consolidated revenues\nwere $403 billion, up 15% on a reported and constant currency basis.\n\nMoving to Q4 performance. We delivered strong growth in the fourth quarter.\nConsolidated revenues reached $113.8 billion, up 18% or 17% in constant\ncurrency and was driven by an acceleration in Search and Cloud revenues.\nTurning to costs and expenses. We reported a $2.1 billion stock-based\ncompensation charge due to an increase in Waymo's valuation related to the\ninvestment round that was announced on Monday. The vast majority of the\ncharge was reflected in R&D expenses. Total cost of revenue was $45.8\nbillion, up 13%. Tech was $16.6 billion, up 12%. Other cost of revenues was\n$29.2 billion, up 13%, with the increase primarily driven by depreciation\nassociated with the deployment of our technical infrastructure, content\nacquisition costs largely for YouTube and other technical infrastructure\noperations costs.\n\nTotal operating expenses were up 29% to $32.1 billion. R&D expense\nincreased by 42%, driven by compensation and depreciation. The increase in\ncompensation was due to the Waymo charge and investment in AI talent. Sales\nand marketing expenses were up 12%, primarily driven by marketing\ninvestments to support the Gemini app and Search. And G&A expenses\nincreased 21%, primarily due to a shift in timing of our charitable\ncontributions. Operating income increased 16% to $35.9 billion, and\noperating margin was 31.6%. Both operating income and operating margin were\nnegatively impacted by the $2.1 billion Waymo charge in the quarter.\n\nOther income and expenses was $3.2 billion, primarily due to unrealized\ngains in our nonmarketable equity securities portfolio. Net income\nincreased 30% to $34.5 billion and earnings per share increased 31% to\n$2.82. We generated record operating cash flow of $52.4 billion in the\nfourth quarter and $164.7 billion for the full year. This translated into\n$24.6 billion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter and $73.3 billion for\nthe full year. We ended the quarter with $126.8 billion in cash and\nmarketable securities and $46.5 billion in long-term debt.\n\nTurning to segment results. Google Services revenues increased 14% to $95.9\nbillion, reflecting strong growth in search and subscriptions. Google\nSearch and other advertising revenues increased by 17% to $63.1 billion,\nrepresenting another strong quarter with continued growth across all major\nverticals with the largest contribution from retail. YouTube advertising\nrevenues increased 9% to $11.4 billion, driven by direct response\nadvertising. Results were negatively affected from the lapping of the\nstrong spend on U.S. election in the fourth quarter of 2024 that we've\nmentioned on previous earnings calls. Network advertising revenues of $7.8\nbillion were down 2%. Subscription platforms and devices revenues increased\n17% this quarter to $13.6 billion due to strong growth in YouTube\nsubscriptions, particularly YouTube Music and Premium and growth in Google\nOne, which benefited from increased demand for AI plans.\n\nGoogle Services operating income increased 22% to $40.1 billion, and\noperating margins was 41.9%. The Google Cloud segment delivered outstanding\nresults in the fourth quarter as the business continued to benefit from\nstrong demand for our enterprise AI products. Cloud revenue accelerated\nmeaningfully and were up 48% to $17.7 billion. Revenues were driven by\nstrong performance in GCP, which continued to grow at a rate that was much\nhigher than cloud's overall revenue growth rate. As Sundar noted, we're\ndriving performance through strong growth in the win rate of new customers,\nsigning larger customer commitments and increasing spend with existing\ncustomers. GCP's performance was driven by accelerating growth in\nenterprise AI products, which are generating billions in quarterly\nrevenues.\n\nWe had strong growth in both enterprise AI infrastructure, driven by\ndeployment of TPUs and GPUs and enterprise AI solutions, which benefited\nfrom demand for our industry-leading models, including Gemini 3. Core GCP\nwas also a meaningful contributor to growth due to strong demand for\ninfrastructure and other services such as cybersecurity and data analytics.\nWe also had double-digit growth in Workspace, driven by an increase in\naverage revenue per seats and the number of seats. Cloud operating income\nwas $5.3 billion, more than doubling year-over-year, and operating margin\nincreased from 17.5% in the fourth quarter of last year to 30.1%. Google\nCloud's backlog increased 55% sequentially and more than doubled year-over-\nyear, reaching $240 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. The increase\nin backlog was driven by strong demand for our cloud products, led by our\nenterprise AI offerings from multiple customers.\n\nIn Other Bets, revenues were $370 million, and operating loss was $3.6\nbillion, reflecting the $2.1 billion Waymo charge I mentioned earlier. We\nallocate resources in Other Bets to businesses like Waymo, where we see\nmeaningful opportunities to create value. Alphabet funded a significant\nportion of the $16 billion investment round that Waymo announced on Monday,\nwhich will allow the business to accelerate its global expansion. CapEx was\n$27.9 billion for the fourth quarter and $91.4 billion for the full year,\nin line with our expectation. The vast majority of our CapEx was invested\nin technical infrastructure with approximately 60% of that investment in\nservers and 40% in data centers and networking equipment. In Q4, we\nreturned capital to shareholders through $5.5 billion of share repurchase\nand $2.5 billion of dividend payments.\n\nTurning to our outlook. I would like to provide some commentary on factors\nthat will impact our business performance in the first quarter and full\nyear 2026. First, in terms of revenues, we're pleased with the overall\nmomentum of the business. At current spot rates, we would expect to see an\nFX tailwind to our consolidated revenues in Q1. However, the volatility in\nexchange rates could affect the impact of FX on Q1 revenues. In Google\nServices, we expect growth to be driven by ongoing innovation in the user\nexperience as well as improved ROI for advertisers, keeping in mind the\nnormal seasonal pattern for advertising revenue. In Google Cloud, we're\nseeing significant demand for our products and services, which we expect to\ncontinue to drive strong growth despite the tight supply environment we're\noperating in.\n\nMoving to investments. The investment we have been making in AI are already\ntranslating into strong performance across the business, as you've seen in\nour financial results. Our successful execution, coupled with strong\nperformance reinforces our conviction to make the investments required to\nfurther capitalize on the AI opportunity. For the full year 2026, we expect\nCapEx to be in the range of $175 billion to $185 billion with investments\nramping over the course of the year. We're investing in AI compute capacity\nto support Frontier model development by Google DeepMind, ongoing efforts\nto improve the user experience and drive higher advertiser ROI in Google\nServices, significant cloud customer demand as well as strategic\ninvestments in Other Bets. Keep in mind that the availability of supply,\npricing of components and timing of cash payments can cause some\nvariability in the reported CapEx number.\n\nIn terms of expenses, as we've discussed on previous calls, the significant\nincrease in our investments in technical infrastructure will continue to\nput pressure on the P&L in the form of higher depreciation expense and\nrelated data centers operations costs such as energy. In 2025, depreciation\nincreased by nearly $6 billion or 38% from $15.3 billion in 2024 to $21.1\nbillion in 2025. Given the increase in our CapEx investments in recent\nyears, we expect the growth rate in 2026 depreciation to accelerate in Q1\nand meaningfully increase for the full year. We're also planning to\ncontinue hiring in key investment areas such as AI and cloud. In 2025, our\nteams delivered amazing innovation, executing with a high level of\ndiscipline and velocity. These efforts provide great experiences for\nconsumers and outstanding performance for creators, partners and enterprise\ncustomers, driving strong revenue growth. I want to take this opportunity\nto thank our employees for their contribution to this impressive\nperformance.\nNow Sundar, Philipp and I will take your questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Brian Nowak with\nMorgan Stanley.\n\nBrian Thomas Nowak\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\n\nI have 2, one on agentic, one on YouTube. The first one on agentic. Sundar,\nI'd be curious to hear about as you look back at 2025, where do you think\nyou made the most progress on new types of agentic commerce products? And\nthen looking into '26, where are you most optimistic to sort of have even\nmore progress in utility for users and your advertisers? And the second one\nis on YouTube. We've seen a lot of the new content creation models like\nGenie, et cetera. Walk us through sort of the Alphabet long-term vision for\nhow Genie and some of these content creation tools could be integrated into\nYouTube over time.\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nGreat. Thanks. Thanks, Brian. First, maybe I'll take the agentic part\nfirst. I definitely think '25 was more about laying the foundation, getting\nthe models to start being more robust in agentic use cases. And obviously,\ncoding is an area where the progress was the most felt. In areas like\ncommerce, I think we spent the year working with the ecosystem to develop\nthe underlying protocol that's going to be needed for this agentic world.\nSo I think the launch of Universal Commerce Protocol at NRF in January with\na bunch of partners, founding partners, I think has been super well\nreceived. So I'm excited now that we have laid the foundation of\ninteroperability on which agentic commerce can work. And now we are\nintegrating those experiences into Gemini, AI Mode and so on. So I think\nthis is a year where you will see consumers actually being able to use all\nof this, and I'm excited about the opportunity ahead.\n\nOn YouTube, look, super excited by Genie and blown away by -- spent a lot\nof time creating this incredible worlds. I think it's going to have a wide\nlevel of applicability. I think an area where we shine in general is\nmultimodality and representing the real world. And I think Genie is a\nfurther step in that direction in terms of building world models. All the\ninnovation we are doing, be it a Imagen, Veo, Lyria, Genie, all that work\nwe bring in into our products and to our cloud customers. And YouTube is\ngoing to be a natural place for creators. We are going to keep\nincorporating these tools. Already creators are responding by adopting\nthese, but we do want to put creators at the center of the experience, and\nthat's very, very important to us. And so it's for us making sure YouTube\nis a voice for creator expression is the foundation by which we will\napproach this.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.\n\nEric James Sheridan\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\n\nTwo, if I could. Over the last couple of earnings calls, we've talked a lot\nabout imbalances between demand and capacity for AI, both internally and\nexternally. With the step function change in absolute capital dollars\nyou're projecting now in '26, can you talk about the pathway to closing the\ngaps or the need for compute, both internally and externally and how to\nthink about some of the outputs of closing that gap as the year progresses.\nAnd again, the second part would be against that level of spend that you're\nnow projecting for '26, how do you think about continuing to find operating\nefficiencies inside the business to fund those investment -- growth\ninvestments as well?\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Eric. You are right, and we've been supply constrained even as\nwe've been ramping up our capacity. Obviously, our CapEx spend this year is\nan eye towards the future. And you have to keep in mind some of the time\nhorizons that are increasing in the supply chain, et cetera. So we are\nconstantly planning for the long term and working towards that. And\nobviously, how we close the gap this year is a function of what we have\ndone in the prior years, right? And so there is that time delay to keep in\nmind. I expect the demand we are seeing across the board across our\nservices, what we need to invest for future work for Google DeepMind as\nwell as for cloud, I think, is exceptionally strong. And so I do expect to\ngo through the year in a supply-constrained way. And maybe Anat can touch\non the second part.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nYes. Sure. Thanks, Eric, for the question. I've mentioned on one of the\nprevious earnings call, our approach to how we look at efficiency and\nproductivity. And we don't view this as an episodic onetime project or\neffort, but rather how we run the business on a regular basis and always\nseek additional opportunities to drive efficiency across the business. And\ncertainly, with the demand we're seeing, whether it's from external\ncustomers or across the organization, the more capital we can free up\nwithin the organization to invest, the better we can turn this flywheel of\nmaking investments to drive future growth.\n\nAnd we're doing this across the organization, whether it's within our\ntechnical infrastructure, certainly, when we invest at these amounts, we\nlook at how we can ensure that we are the most efficient with every dollar\nthat goes towards our technical infrastructure. There are scientific\ninnovation that are part of that process, technical innovation, as you\nknow, and we've mentioned before, we primarily focus on construction of our\nown data centers. We do partner with some external parties on lease on\noccasion, but most of our data center, we can start ourselves, and we\nensure that we do it in the most efficient way in a way that matches our\nworkloads and our needs.\n\nWe look at coding productivity that Sundar mentioned in the past, our --\nabout 50% of our codes are written by agents, coding agents, which are then\nreviewed by our own engineers. But certainly, it helps our engineers do\nmore and move faster with the current footprint. We look at how we run the\nbusiness across the organization. So using AI within the business to drive\ndaily operations. It can be all the way from the engineering team to small\nteams within our back office, even within my finance team, for example, we\ndeployed agents within our treasury organization. We're deploying agents\nwithin how we run -- how we pay and reconcile invoice, et cetera. So there\nare opportunities across the business that we evaluate on a regular basis\nto ensure we can free up more of that capacity to invest in our future.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\n\nDouglas Till Anmuth\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nI have 2. Over the last couple of years, we've seen considerable large\nlanguage model leapfrogging and many expect that to continue. What are the\nways that Google can build and maintain its Gemini position around data and\ndistribution and product integration? And then how should we think about\nthe potential for TPUs to move outside of Google Cloud and into external\ndata centers and develop as an incremental revenue stream?\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nDoug, look, I think the LLM frontier, it's been an exciting trajectory. And\nI think 2026 will continue to show that progress. We are obviously\nimproving these models across many paradigms, right, on pretraining, post-\ntraining, test and compute and so on. And we are bringing multimodal models\ninto the picture. We are bringing agentic capabilities, the coding area is\nshowing a lot of progress. And obviously, integrating all of this together\nand offering a great customer experience for our -- to our products as well\nas through our APIs to our cloud customers. To me, it feels like there's a\nlot of headroom ahead. And as you've seen our trajectory over the past 2\nyears in terms of how we have been making progress.\n\nI think we are in a very, very relentless innovation cadence. And I think\nwe are confident about maintaining that momentum as we go through '26. In\nterms of TPUs, I would think about it as it's reflected in our overall part\nof what makes Google Cloud an attractive choice is the wide choice of\naccelerators we bring to bear here, and we meet customers in terms of what\ntheir needs are and the choice as well as other things we bring as part of\nGoogle Cloud, the end-to-end efficiencies in our data centers, all of that\ncomes to bear. And that's what you see in the strong momentum in Google\nCloud. And given the overall investment we are making, we expect to be able\nto drive that momentum there. So that's how I would think about it.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore.\n\nMark Stephen F. Mahaney\nEvercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division\n\nTwo questions. One, could you just comment a little bit on the YouTube ad\nrevenue, that 9% year-over-year growth? It sounded like direct response was\ngood. And it sounded like from search that retail came in relatively\nstrong. So it's a little surprising that didn't kind of come through in the\nYouTube ads revenue growth. And then Sundar, can I ask you to try to get\nahead of a debate in the market, which is there's kind of maybe at a\nDeepSeek moment again.\n\nYou talked earlier about Gemini being the AI engine for the most -- for\nsome of the most successful software SaaS companies out there in the world.\nAnd it just seems like there's a market belief that the software companies\nare kind of losing seat power, losing pricing power, and it looks like it\ncould be a really terrible customer base. I can't imagine that that's\nactually going to happen. But could you just talk about it? You're at the\nforefront of AI and the impact that that's having on software companies.\nWhy wouldn't that be or why would it be undermining the economics of your\nlarge software SaaS company base?\n\nPhilipp Schindler\nSenior Vice President & Chief Business Officer of Google\n\nSo Mark, so first of all, thank you for the question. For the full year\n2025, our YouTube's annual revenue surpassed $60 billion across ads and\nsubscription. In Q4, YouTube ads was driven indeed by strong growth in\ndirect response. On the brand side, as Anat shared, the largest factor\nnegatively impacting the year-over-year growth rate was lapping the strong\nspend on U.S. elections. We also saw a slight impact in some other brand-\nrelated verticals. But taking a step back, I think it's important to think\nabout YouTube ads and subs holistically because when a user shifts from\nbeing an ad-supported user to a YouTube Music and Premium customer, it has\na slightly negative impact on YouTube ads revenues, but a positive impact\non our business.\n\nAnd we had strong revenue growth in YouTube subscriptions this quarter,\nparticularly in the YouTube Music and Premium category. Maybe interesting\npart is what we're actually excited about our road map in brand, the\nopportunity on connected TVs, more innovative ad formats, for example, the\nshoppable mastheads I spoke about earlier that we piloted during Cyber 5.\nWe're working really, really hard to further connect brands and creators,\nscaling sponsorships and enabling advertisers to showcase their products,\ntheir services during high visibility spotlight moments.\n\nWe continue to expand the functionality of the creator partnership hub,\nmaking it a lot easier for brands to actually find creators and develop\ncampaigns. We're heavily focusing on brand deals on measurement efforts. So\nthere's a lot of interesting work in the pipeline. And on top of that, we\nactually see opportunity also for upside with performance advertising.\nThere's a lot of momentum with demand gen adoption across small and medium\nadvertisers. We're also excited about the opportunity for continued ads\ninnovation and direct response, like, for example, shoppable formats,\nincluding in the living room, which is then helping drive strength in\nretail, the continued momentum in Shorts and so on. So overall, we're quite\nexcited. Yes.\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nGreat. And Mark, on -- in terms of Gemini adoption and how -- what this\nmoment means for SaaS, et cetera. Look, at least from my vantage point, I\ndefinitely see we have very, very good SaaS customers who are leaders in\ntheir respective categories. And what I see the successful companies doing\nis they are definitely incorporating Gemini deeply in critical workflows,\nbe it on improving their product experience and driving growth or using it\nto drive efficiency within their organizations. And I think it is an\nenabling tool, just like it has been an enabling tool for us across our\nproducts and services, be it Search, YouTube, et cetera. I think the\ncompanies who are seizing the moment, I think, have the same opportunity\nahead. And at least we are excited about the partnerships we have there.\nAnd the momentum, if I look at it in terms of their tokens usage, et\ncetera, the growth has been very robust in Q4.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Mark Shmulik with AllianceBernstein.\n\nMark Elliott Shmulik\nBernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division\n\nTwo, if I may. The first for Anat is can you talk a little bit more about\nthe relationship between investment levels and how you kind of expect core\nperformance to trend? Is there like an operating income or a free cash flow\nobjective that you solve towards? Or how do you think about greenlighting\nresources and projects? And then the second question is for all of you. A\nyear ago, we probably could have guessed the answer to this question. But\ngiven where we are today, for each of you, what keeps you up at night here\nas you think about the Google story and what's next?\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Mark. Let me start with a question on the investment framework, and\nit's an important one. And as you can imagine, an important one for us as\nwell. We have a highly rigorous framework that we use internally where we\nlook at all the needs for investment, whether it's from our own\norganization or from external customers and have an estimate of what that\ninvestment could potentially yield, obviously, not just near term but long\nterm as well. So we take that into consideration when we make the following\ndecision. The first one is the total investment that we make across the\ncompany. This was, for example, in 2025, the $91 billion we invested in\nCapEx and our estimate for CapEx investment this year.\n\nSo what's the total envelope that we want to invest to ensure that we can\ndrive both near-term and long-term growth for the company. And then the\nsecond way we use that framework is to just allocate these funds across the\norganization, determine where we should make these investments. And\nthroughout the year, as you can imagine, we always look to understand where\nthings are moving, whether it's external dynamics or internal dynamics, and\nI've mentioned some of the supply chain pressures we're seeing externally.\nSo we look at this with a highly rigorous framework to make sure that we're\nmaking the right decision. It was exciting to see the fact that we're\nalready monetizing and you saw it in the results that we just issued this\nquarter, the investments that we've made in AI.\n\nIt's already delivering results across the business. I know it in cloud,\nit's very obvious external, but you've heard the comments on the success\nwe're seeing in search, the comments from Sundar and from Philipp and then\nthe Frontier model development that really serves as the foundation for the\norganization. We then also look at just the cash flow, cash flow generation\nand the health of our financials and the balance sheet. That's important as\nwell. So we take that into consideration when we make the decision about\nthe overall level of investment. We want to make sure we do it in a\nfiscally responsible way and that we invest appropriately, but we do it in\na way that maintains a very healthy financial position for the\norganization.\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nAnd yes, maybe I can answer on what keeps us up at night. Look, I think\noverall, we've been on this AI-first trajectory for over a decade now, and\nit's what we have been methodically thinking our way through. It's the\nreason why we've been working on TPUs for over a decade as an example. But\nI think specifically at this moment, maybe the top question is definitely\naround compute capacity, all the constraints, be it power, land, supply\nchain constraints, how do you ramp up to meet this extraordinary demand for\nthis moment, get our investments right for the long term and do it all in a\nway that we are driving efficiencies and doing it in a world-class way. And\nso that's where I think we are meeting the moment well and -- but it's\ndefinitely an area where we're spending a lot of time on.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.\n\nMichael Brian Nathanson\nMoffettNathanson LLC\n\nI have one for Sundar and one for Anat. Sundar, you mentioned the Universal\nCommerce Protocol a bunch of times. I wonder if you could spend some time\ntalking about the rationale for developing it, the opportunity that you see\nit solves for and what it means for the product discovery funnel for\nconsumers? And then for Anat, any color you can provide on the CapEx guide\nbetween longer duration assets like buildings and infrastructure and\nshorter cycle assets like technical equipment? That would be helpful.\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Michael. Obviously, people go through a lot of commercial journeys\nacross many of our surfaces, search, YouTube, Gemini app and so on. So I\nthink there's -- as well as we support through cloud and ads, our entire\nretail partners as well. And the opportunity to improve the experience, I\nthink, can be a kind of a huge foundational uplift here. But it's important\nto -- we are approaching it keeping in mind that our users as well as\nmerchants here and figuring out that value. Part of what's been good in\ndesigning the Universal Commerce Protocol is it makes it much easier for\nusers to complete transactions.\n\nBut at the same time, it allows merchants to help showcase the range of\ntheir offerings, if they want to make promotions, et cetera. So all of that\nis built into the protocol. And I think you have to get that value prop for\nthe ecosystem right to make the experience better. And so it's\nfoundational. And more importantly, we are now implementing the protocols\nand our Gemini models are making progress in those agentic capabilities.\nAnd I think -- so I'm excited about a future where as people are going\nthrough discovery, searching, finding new things, if they're interested in\nacting upon it, all of that is seamless. And so it overall creates an\nexpansionary moment.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nAnd the question with regards to the CapEx and the -- kind of what makes up\nthe total that we've announced for this year and last year, approximately\n60% of our investment in 2025, and it's going to be fairly similar in 2026,\nwent towards machines, so the servers. And then 40% is what you referred to\nas long-duration assets, which is our data centers and network and\nequipment. And I think you probably are referring to the depreciation delta\nbetween them. Those long-term duration assets depreciate over -- the\nbuilding could be 4 years or longer. Other components may be less than\nthat. Another important component is how we allocate this CapEx. And we've\ncommented in the past about the allocation of our ML compute across the\nbusiness. And for 2026, just over half of our ML compute is expected to go\ntowards the cloud business.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays.\n\nRoss Adam Sandler\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\n\nGreat. Just a question on the native Gemini 750 million. So we added 100\nmillion MAUs in the fourth quarter. Could you just talk high level about\nusage and retention of native Gemini? And is this 750 million the right way\nto measure your progress against companies like ChatGPT or is there another\ncohort of users that aren't in that 750 million that maybe we should also\nconsider?\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nRoss, I think we definitely saw, I would say, an extraordinary period of\ngrowth in Q4 for Gemini app. It's not just the growth in monthly active\nusers, but there's definitely -- there was a sharp increase in engagement\nper user on the app. So all the metrics be it active usage, the intensity\nof usage, retention all showed distinct progress across iOS, web, Android,\net cetera, and geographically globally. So definitely, all the product\nexperience improvements, the work we did with Nano Banana, the progress\nwith the Gemini models all translated into strong momentum and that\nmomentum is continuing. So we are excited about that, and we'll continue to\ninvest. Obviously, there are many people who are getting a deeply AI-native\nexperience in the context of AI mode in search as well. And we are\ndefinitely seeing strong growth and progress. And the introduction of\nGemini 3 in AI mode was a very positive driver as well. And obviously,\nwe'll continue to evolve these experiences, and I'm excited about the\nopportunities there.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo.\n\nKenneth James Gawrelski\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\n\nTwo, if I may, both on search. First, could you walk us through how you are\nevolving your views on the monetization of AI search activity given the\nmore conversational nature and longer periods of engagement per session,\nconsumer utility is increasingly driven by the on-platform results, not\nspecifically the linkouts and referrals. In that construct, how do you\nthink about increasing the revenue opportunity to match the consumer\nutility? And is this increasingly where premium subscriptions play? And\nthen question two, and it's related, as you think about partnerships such\nas the new Apple partnership on Siri, how do you think about the right way\nto align for success with those partners? Previously, as disclosed in the\nDOJ documents, et cetera, it was a revenue share relationship. But now if\nyou think about the utility that you're driving through AI search and\nthrough Gemini on those platforms, it may be less related to the actual\n'search revenue'. Could you just talk a little bit about how you align with\npartners for success there?\n\nPhilipp Schindler\nSenior Vice President & Chief Business Officer of Google\n\nSo first of all, it may be worthwhile to say that the acceleration we saw\nin search was not due to a single driver, but was really the result of many\ndifferent parts of our business showing strength and working well together.\nAnd maybe I quickly add the vertical perspective, retail, finance, health\ndrove actually the greatest contribution to search revenue, though nearly\nevery major vertical actually accelerated in Q4. More specifically to your\nquestion, the ongoing innovation is, as you know, core to what we do and\nthe enhancements to the user and the advertiser experience really continue\nto drive our performance, and we make hundreds of these changes every\nquarter.\n\nWe see AI Overviews and AI Mode continue to drive greater search usage and\ngrowth in overall queries, including important in commercial queries.\nGemini-based improvements in search ads help us better match queries and\ncraft creatives for advertisers. I talked about the understanding of intent\nand how this has significantly expanded our ability to deliver ads on\nlonger and more complex searches that were, frankly, previously difficult\nto monetize. AI Max, for example, is already used by hundreds of thousands\nof advertisers and continues to unlock billions of net new queries in that\nsense. We see strength with SMB advertisers expanding their budgets and\nadopting automation tools, leading to better ROI. On the creative side,\nwe're using Gemini to generate millions of creative assets via text\ncustomization in AI Max and PMax and so on. So we're very pleased with what\nwe're seeing here.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our last question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America.\n\nJustin Post\nBofA Securities, Research Division\n\nGreat. Just want to follow up on the Gemini app. Obviously, great growth\nthere. Are you seeing any cannibalization of search as far as activity as\npeople start using that app more? And then second, on monetization, where\nare you on that? And with agentic and other ads coming, could that be\nincremental to your growth over the next few years?\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nLook, right now, overall, look, I think we are giving people choice. People\nare obviously using search, experiencing AI Overviews and AI Mode as part\nof it and Gemini app as well. And the combination of all of that, I think,\ncreates an expansionary moment. I think it's expanding the type of queries\npeople do with Google overall. And so overall, some of it all is what we\nsee as a growth opportunity, and we haven't seen any evidence of\ncannibalization there. And maybe Philipp can comment on the monetization.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\nSenior Vice President & Chief Business Officer of Google\n\nYes. I think Sundar previously commented on agentic and how we think about\nit. And look, in general, as with all of our products, we really focus,\nfirst and foremost, on creating a great user experience, and we're very\nexcited about where we are with the ads and AI Overviews and early\nexperiments in AI Mode, including innovations like Direct Offers and our\nroad map for the future. In terms of the Gemini app today, we are focused\non our free tier and subscriptions and seeing great growth, as Sundar\ndiscussed. But ads have always been part of scaling products to reach\nbillions of people. And if done well, ads can be really valuable and\nhelpful commercial information. And at the right moment, we'll share any\nplans. But as we've said, we're not rushing anything here.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to\nturn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks.\n\nJames H. Friedland\nSenior Director of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with\nyou again on our first quarter 2026 call. Thank you, and have a good\nevening.\n\nOperatorThank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call.

  "presentation_text": "Operator\n\nWelcome, everyone. Thank you for standing by for the Alphabet Fourth\nQuarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now\nlike to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Head\nof Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJames H. Friedland\nSenior Director of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's Fourth\nQuarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Sundar Pichai,\nPhilipp Schindler and Anat Ashkenazi. Now I'll quickly cover the safe\nharbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business,\noperations and financial performance may be considered forward-looking.\nSuch statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are\nsubject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ\nmaterially.\n\nPlease refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q, including the risk factors. We\nundertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. During\nthis call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A\nreconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings\npress release, which is distributed and available to the public through our\nInvestor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Our comments will\nbe on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise. And now I'll\nturn the call over to Sundar.\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Jim. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us. It was a tremendous\nquarter for Alphabet. The launch of Gemini 3 was a major milestone, and we\nhave great momentum. Alphabet annual revenues exceeded $400 billion for the\nfirst time. This quarter, Search continued to accelerate with revenues\ngrowing 17%. YouTube's annual revenues surpassed $60 billion across ads and\nsubscriptions. Cloud significantly accelerated with revenues growing 48%,\nnow on an annual run rate of over $70 billion. Backlog grew by 55% quarter-\nover-quarter to $240 billion, representing a wide breadth of customers\ndriven by demand for AI products. We have over 325 million paid\nsubscriptions across consumer services with strong adoption for Google One\nand YouTube Premium.\n\nIn addition, we have sold more than 8 million paid seats of Gemini\nEnterprise, which we launched just 4 months ago. And our Gemini app now has\nover 750 million monthly active users. We are also seeing significantly\nhigher engagement per user, especially since the launch of Gemini 3 in\nDecember. Overall, we are seeing our AI investments and infrastructure\ndrive revenue and growth across the board. To meet customer demand and\ncapitalize on the growing opportunities ahead of us, our 2026 CapEx\ninvestments are anticipated to be in the range of $175 billion to $185\nbillion. Today, I'll provide an update on our AI progress and then share\nhighlights from Search, Cloud, YouTube and Waymo. First, AI progress across\nthe full stack. Our unrivaled infrastructure serves as the bedrock of our\nAI stack. We have the industry's widest variety of compute options.\n\nThat includes GPUs from our partner, NVIDIA, who announced at CES, that\nwe'll be among the first to offer their latest Vera Rubin GPU platform,\nplus our own TPUs that we have been developing for a decade. In December,\nwe announced our intent to acquire Intersect, which provides data center\nand energy infrastructure solutions. As we scale, we are getting\ndramatically more efficient. We were able to lower Gemini serving unit cost\nby 78% over 2025 through model optimizations, efficiency and utilization\nimprovements. Next, world-class AI research, including models and tooling.\nWe offer the most extensive model portfolio in the world and lead across\ntext, vision and image to video LMArena leaderboards. Gemini 3 Pro drives\nthe state-of-the-art in reasoning and multimodal understanding. It has seen\nthe fastest adoption of any model in our history.\n\nSince launch, Gemini 3 Pro has consistently processed 3x as many daily\ntokens on average as 2.5 Pro. Our latest model powers Google Antigravity,\nour new development platform where agents can autonomously plan and execute\ncomplex software tasks. It already has more than 1.5 million weekly active\nusers after launching just over 2 months ago. Our first-party models like\nGemini now process over 10 billion tokens per minute via direct API used by\nour customers, up from 7 billion last quarter. Third, bringing AI to our\nproducts and platforms. We are shipping innovation at scale to bring\nhelpful AI features to people everywhere. In January alone, we have\nlaunched personal intelligence in AI mode in search and the Gemini app,\nintroduced new features to Gmail an updated view, reimagine Chrome as an AI-\nfirst agentic browser through features like Chrome Auto Browse; announced\nProject Genie, which lets users create and explore interactive worlds\ngenerated in real time using Genie 3, our general purpose world model.\n\nAnd we laid the groundwork for shopping in the AI era by introducing a new\nopen standard for agentic commerce, the universal commerce protocol built\nalongside many retail industry leaders. Finally, from Android to Pixel, we\nare getting our best AI capabilities into people's hands. At CES, a range\nof partners, including Samsung, showcased how they are bringing Gemini to\nmore devices from XR to the living room and beyond. And to confirm the\nrumors, we'll be introducing our Pixel 10a to our best-ever-rated Pixel 10\nseries very soon. Turning now to key highlights from the quarter, starting\nwith search. Search saw more usage in Q4 than ever before as AI continues\nto drive an expansionary moment. We have executed with incredible speed. We\nshipped over 250 product launches within AI Mode and AI Overviews just last\nquarter. We have integrated Gemini 3 directly into AI mode in search.\n\nNow search can better understand your query, dive deeper on the web and\ngenerate interactive UI experiences. And last week, we upgraded AI\nOverviews to Gemini 3, giving users a best-in-class AI response at the top\nof the search results page. We have also made the search experience more\ncohesive, ensuring the transition from an AI overview to a conversation in\nAI mode is completely seamless. These new experiences are proving to be\nmore helpful and are driving greater usage. A few highlights. First, once\npeople start using these new experiences, they use them more. In the U.S.,\nwe saw daily AI Mode queries per user double since launch and AI Overviews\ncontinue to perform very well. Second, people are engaging in longer, more\ncomplex sessions.\n\nQueries in AI Mode are 3x longer than traditional searches. We are also\nseeing sessions become more conversational with a significant portion of\nqueries in AI Mode now leading to a follow-up question. Third, people are\nsearching in new ways beyond text. Nearly 1 in 6 AI Mode queries are now\nnontext using voice or images. And Circle to Search is now available on\nover 580 million Android devices. Next, Google Cloud. Our growth in\nrevenue, operating margin and backlog highlights the strength of our entire\nportfolio. One, we are winning more new customers faster. We exited the\nyear with double the new customer velocity compared to Q1. Two, we are also\nsigning larger customer commitments. The number of deals in 2025, over $1\nbillion surpassed the previous 3 years combined. And three, we continue to\ndeepen our relationships with existing customers who are outpacing their\ninitial commitments by over 30%.\n\nNearly 75% of Google Cloud customers have used our vertically optimized AI\nfrom chips to models to AI platforms and enterprise AI agents, which offer\nsuperior performance, quality, security and cost efficiency. These AI\ncustomers use 1.8x as many products as those who do not, enabling us to\ndiversify our product portfolio, deepen customer relationships and\naccelerate revenue growth. Our product line has multiple monetization\nlevers spanning infrastructure, platform and high-margin AI-powered\nproducts and services with 14 product lines each exceeding $1 billion in\nannual revenue. We offer leading infrastructure for AI training and\ninference to our cloud customers with the industry's widest variety of\ncompute options from our own seventh-generation Ironwood TPU to the latest\nNVIDIA GPUs. Our 10-year track record in building our own accelerators with\nexpertise in chips, systems, networking and software translates to leading\npower and performance efficiency for large-scale inference and training.\n\nOur cloud AI accelerators serve the leading Frontier AI labs, capital\nmarkets firms like Citadel Securities, enterprises like Mercedes-Benz and\ngovernments for high-performance computing applications. We also offer our\nleading generative AI models, including Gemini, Imagen, Veo, Chirp and\nLyria to cloud customers. In December alone, nearly 350 customers each\nprocessed more than 100 billion tokens. In Q4, revenue from products built\non our generative AI models grew nearly 400% year-over-year, significantly\naccelerating from the prior quarter. Today, more than 120,000 enterprises\nuse Gemini, including AI unicorns like Lovable and OpenEvidence and global\nenterprises like Airbus and Honeywell. 95% of the top 20 and over 80% of\nthe top 100 SaaS companies use Gemini, including Salesforce and Shopify.\nGemini is becoming the AI engine for the world's most successful software\ncompanies.\n\nLeading enterprises are also driving strong demand for our enterprise AI\nagents. We have sold more than 8 million paid seats of Gemini Enterprise,\nour enterprise AI platform to more than 2,800 companies, including BNY and\nVirgin Voyages to streamline knowledge management and automate processes.\nGemini Enterprise managed over 5 billion customer interactions in Q4,\ngrowing 65% year-over-year for customers, including Wendy's, Kroger and\nWoolworths Group. Our integration of Gemini and Google Workspace is driving\nwins with global brands like Schwarz Group and public sector organizations\nlike the U.S. Department of Transportation. We are also seeing momentum\nwith independent software vendors. Revenue from AI solutions built by our\npartners increased nearly 300% year-over-year and commitments from our top\n15 software partners grew more than 16x year-over-year.\n\nBefore moving on, I'm pleased that we are collaborating with Apple as their\npreferred cloud provider and to develop the next generation of Apple\nFoundation Models based on Gemini technology. Up next, YouTube. I want to\nhighlight 4 points. First, streaming. In the living room, YouTube continues\nto be the #1 streamer in the U.S. for nearly 3 years according to Nielsen.\nFrom the NFL to Coachella, YouTube is where people watch today's biggest\npopular culture moments unfold. Second, subscriptions. We continue to see\nstrong subscription revenue growth across YouTube, particularly YouTube\nMusic Premium. We'll soon launch new YouTube TV plans, bringing more choice\nand flexibility to subscribers with over 10 genre-specific packages.\n\nAnd the NFL has seen strong NFL Sunday Ticket subscriber growth with\nYouTube, with the highest paid subscriber number ever in the history of the\nproduct. Third, podcasts. To illustrate YouTube's popularity, in October\n2025, viewers watched over 700 million hours of podcasts on living room\ndevices, up 75% from just a year prior. And fourth, AI is transforming the\nYouTube experience for both creators and viewers. On average, every day in\nDecember, over 1 million channels used our new AI creation tools to\nsupercharge their creativity. During that same month, more than 20 million\nviewers used our new Ask tool powered by Gemini to learn more about the\ncontent they watched.\n\nAnd finally, Waymo. This week, Waymo raised its largest investment round to\ndate and is well positioned to continue its momentum with safety at the\ncore. In December, we surpassed 20 million fully autonomous trips and are\nnow providing more than 400,000 rides every week. Waymo continues to expand\nits service territory. Its sixth market, Miami, launched 2 weeks ago, and\nWaymo will soon expand its service to multiple cities across the U.S. and\nin the U.K. and Japan. The team has made incredible progress on important\ncapabilities, including opening up public service to airports and freeways.\nIn closing, 2025 was a fantastic year for the company. A big thanks to our\nemployees and partners worldwide. We are really well positioned going into\n2026. Now over to Philipp.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\nSenior Vice President & Chief Business Officer of Google\n\nThanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. I'll cover performance for Google\nServices for the quarter, then structure the rest of my remarks around the\ngreat progress we're delivering across Search, YouTube and partnerships.\nGoogle Services revenues were $96 billion for the quarter, up 14% year-on-\nyear, primarily driven by accelerated growth in search. Adding some further\ncolor to our results. The 17% increase in search and other was led by broad\nstrength across all major verticals with retail particularly strong. On\nYouTube, the 9% growth in advertising revenues was driven by direct\nresponse. Network advertising revenues were down 2% year-on-year this\nquarter. Starting with search and other revenues, which delivered over $63\nbillion in revenue for the quarter.\n\nSundar mentioned the expansionary moment for search. The same is true for\nads. We're investing in AI to drive significant improvements across all\nareas of marketing. We're expanding the entire playing field that\nadvertisers can compete on. AI gives businesses the ability to reach more\ncustomers in more places than ever before. Gemini uniquely positions us to\nbring the transformational benefits of AI to ads in 3 critical areas for\nour customers: ads quality, advertiser tools and new AI user experiences.\nFirst, ads quality. We've been deploying Gemini models to improve query\nunderstanding at a rate of almost a launch per month for the last 2 years.\nThese improvements drive better query matching, ranking and quality, making\nsearch ads even more effective. With Gemini across our ads quality stack,\nwe evaluate relevance with greater accuracy than with previous generations\nof models.\n\nThis has significantly improved our ability to systematically deliver more\nhelpful high-quality ads, contributing to a meaningful reduction in\nirrelevant ads served. Gemini's understanding of intent has increased our\nability to deliver ads on longer, more complex searches that were\npreviously challenging to monetize. Gemini models also have a significant\nimpact on query understanding in non-English languages, expanding\nopportunities for businesses to scale globally. Second, we're building more\nagentic actions into our advertiser tools. Businesses can now leverage\nGemini in conversational experiences within Ads and Analytics Advisor to\nidentify and run recommended actions such as generating new campaigns.\nAdvertisers use Gemini as a real-time partner to assemble creatives.\n\nIn Q4 alone, they used Gemini to create nearly 70 million creative assets\nvia text customization in AI Max and PMax. For instance, Aritzia, Canada's\npremier fashion house used AI Max to find new high-value customers that\ntraditional strategies miss, delivering an 80% incremental uplift in\nconversion value for Q4. L'Oreal, one of the first alpha testers used AI\nMax in 2025 across 800 unique campaigns in 23 countries and 30 brands. AI\nMax enabled the L'Oreal Group to maximize its presence across the full\nconsumer journey, fuel its consumer growth and increase revenue for DTC\nbrands like NYX by 23%. The third area is how we monetize new AI user\nexperiences in search. We have significantly increased our focus on AI mode\nand are in the early stages of experimenting with AI mode monetization like\ntesting ads below the AI response with more underway.\n\nFor example, we announced Direct Offers, a new Google Ads pilot, which will\nallow advertisers to show exclusive offers for shoppers who are ready to\nbuy directly in AI mode. This new type of sponsored content uses AI to\nmatch the right offer provided by the retailer to the right user. As Sundar\nmentioned, we are building the era of agentic commerce and working with our\npartners to introduce the universal commerce protocol in our consumer\nproducts and across the web. We've received tremendous feedback from the\nindustry. Soon, people can use a new checkout experience to buy directly in\nAI mode in Gemini from select merchants. Turning now to YouTube, which\nremains the #1 streamer in the U.S. for nearly 3 years according to\nNielsen. YouTube creators are providing an unmatched breadth of content.\nOur investment in AI innovation across creativity, viewing experience and\nmonetization continues to pay off.\n\nWe're seeing strong traction in our subscription business, are innovating\nto meet consumers where they are. We added a new sports tier for YouTube TV\nat a lower price point. YouTube Premium Lite is proving to be a popular\nchoice. And we continue to deliver strong year-on-year growth across\nYouTube subscriptions, particularly YouTube Music and Premium. Looking at\nmonetization across YouTube, momentum continues in Shorts in the living\nroom. Shorts now averages over 200 billion daily views. And as we've shared\nbefore, in a number of countries, Shorts earns more revenue per watch hour\nthan traditional in-stream on YouTube, including the U.S. The retail\nvertical continues to grow, fueled by smaller advertisers increasingly\nadopting demand channel. Likewise, direct response continues to benefit\nfrom the momentum we're seeing with small- and medium-sized advertisers.\n\nViewers trust product and brand recommendations from YouTube creators, and\nwe are focused on making YouTube a premier shopping destination.\nInnovations like shoppable ad formats are improving advertiser return on\ninvestment. During Cyber 5, advertisers piloted shoppable mastheads, a new\ninteractive ad format where viewers browse products and send links to their\nphones for an easy shopping experience. On brands, our creator partnership\nhub makes it easier for brands to find creators and develop campaigns. This\nholiday season, brands like JCPenney, Old Navy and Target worked with\ncreators for their holiday campaigns.\n\nMattel partnered with 8 top YouTube creators to reach families during the\npeak holiday shopping season in a campaign that helped drive a 25% increase\nin search volume for UNO. As always, I wrap with the progress we're seeing\nacross partnerships where customers tap into the strength and breadth of\nGoogle's products to accelerate their transformation. I would start by\njoining Sundar in saying how pleased I am that we are collaborating with\nApple as their preferred cloud provider and to develop the next generation\nof Apple Foundation Models based on Gemini technology. We partnered with\nReliance Jio to provide over 500 million consumers with an 18-month free\ntrial of our Gemini suite of products and 2 terabyte of cloud storage.\n\nReliance Enterprise customers will also get access to Google Cloud's Gemini\nEnterprise and TPUs, bringing the best of Google AI to every employee and\nworkflow. The Home Depot is applying Google AI across the board from cloud\ntools to AI-powered ads and YouTube creator partnerships that connect with\nthe next generation off to us. Their investments in PMax and YouTube\ncreator partnerships have resulted in double-digit increase in ad clicks\nand visits. In closing, I'd like to thank Googlers everywhere for their\ncontributions to our success and as always, to our customers and partners\nfor their continued trust. Anat, over to you.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Philipp. My comments will focus on year-over-year comparisons\nfor the fourth quarter, unless I state otherwise. I will start with results\nat the Alphabet level and will then cover segment results. I'll end with\nsome commentary on our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2026.\n2025 was a strong year of innovation and execution for Alphabet. These\nefforts, combined with our investments in AI, drove meaningful results\nacross the business. For the full year 2025, Alphabet consolidated revenues\nwere $403 billion, up 15% on a reported and constant currency basis.\n\nMoving to Q4 performance. We delivered strong growth in the fourth quarter.\nConsolidated revenues reached $113.8 billion, up 18% or 17% in constant\ncurrency and was driven by an acceleration in Search and Cloud revenues.\nTurning to costs and expenses. We reported a $2.1 billion stock-based\ncompensation charge due to an increase in Waymo's valuation related to the\ninvestment round that was announced on Monday. The vast majority of the\ncharge was reflected in R&D expenses. Total cost of revenue was $45.8\nbillion, up 13%. Tech was $16.6 billion, up 12%. Other cost of revenues was\n$29.2 billion, up 13%, with the increase primarily driven by depreciation\nassociated with the deployment of our technical infrastructure, content\nacquisition costs largely for YouTube and other technical infrastructure\noperations costs.\n\nTotal operating expenses were up 29% to $32.1 billion. R&D expense\nincreased by 42%, driven by compensation and depreciation. The increase in\ncompensation was due to the Waymo charge and investment in AI talent. Sales\nand marketing expenses were up 12%, primarily driven by marketing\ninvestments to support the Gemini app and Search. And G&A expenses\nincreased 21%, primarily due to a shift in timing of our charitable\ncontributions. Operating income increased 16% to $35.9 billion, and\noperating margin was 31.6%. Both operating income and operating margin were\nnegatively impacted by the $2.1 billion Waymo charge in the quarter.\n\nOther income and expenses was $3.2 billion, primarily due to unrealized\ngains in our nonmarketable equity securities portfolio. Net income\nincreased 30% to $34.5 billion and earnings per share increased 31% to\n$2.82. We generated record operating cash flow of $52.4 billion in the\nfourth quarter and $164.7 billion for the full year. This translated into\n$24.6 billion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter and $73.3 billion for\nthe full year. We ended the quarter with $126.8 billion in cash and\nmarketable securities and $46.5 billion in long-term debt.\n\nTurning to segment results. Google Services revenues increased 14% to $95.9\nbillion, reflecting strong growth in search and subscriptions. Google\nSearch and other advertising revenues increased by 17% to $63.1 billion,\nrepresenting another strong quarter with continued growth across all major\nverticals with the largest contribution from retail. YouTube advertising\nrevenues increased 9% to $11.4 billion, driven by direct response\nadvertising. Results were negatively affected from the lapping of the\nstrong spend on U.S. election in the fourth quarter of 2024 that we've\nmentioned on previous earnings calls. Network advertising revenues of $7.8\nbillion were down 2%. Subscription platforms and devices revenues increased\n17% this quarter to $13.6 billion due to strong growth in YouTube\nsubscriptions, particularly YouTube Music and Premium and growth in Google\nOne, which benefited from increased demand for AI plans.\n\nGoogle Services operating income increased 22% to $40.1 billion, and\noperating margins was 41.9%. The Google Cloud segment delivered outstanding\nresults in the fourth quarter as the business continued to benefit from\nstrong demand for our enterprise AI products. Cloud revenue accelerated\nmeaningfully and were up 48% to $17.7 billion. Revenues were driven by\nstrong performance in GCP, which continued to grow at a rate that was much\nhigher than cloud's overall revenue growth rate. As Sundar noted, we're\ndriving performance through strong growth in the win rate of new customers,\nsigning larger customer commitments and increasing spend with existing\ncustomers. GCP's performance was driven by accelerating growth in\nenterprise AI products, which are generating billions in quarterly\nrevenues.\n\nWe had strong growth in both enterprise AI infrastructure, driven by\ndeployment of TPUs and GPUs and enterprise AI solutions, which benefited\nfrom demand for our industry-leading models, including Gemini 3. Core GCP\nwas also a meaningful contributor to growth due to strong demand for\ninfrastructure and other services such as cybersecurity and data analytics.\nWe also had double-digit growth in Workspace, driven by an increase in\naverage revenue per seats and the number of seats. Cloud operating income\nwas $5.3 billion, more than doubling year-over-year, and operating margin\nincreased from 17.5% in the fourth quarter of last year to 30.1%. Google\nCloud's backlog increased 55% sequentially and more than doubled year-over-\nyear, reaching $240 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. The increase\nin backlog was driven by strong demand for our cloud products, led by our\nenterprise AI offerings from multiple customers.\n\nIn Other Bets, revenues were $370 million, and operating loss was $3.6\nbillion, reflecting the $2.1 billion Waymo charge I mentioned earlier. We\nallocate resources in Other Bets to businesses like Waymo, where we see\nmeaningful opportunities to create value. Alphabet funded a significant\nportion of the $16 billion investment round that Waymo announced on Monday,\nwhich will allow the business to accelerate its global expansion. CapEx was\n$27.9 billion for the fourth quarter and $91.4 billion for the full year,\nin line with our expectation. The vast majority of our CapEx was invested\nin technical infrastructure with approximately 60% of that investment in\nservers and 40% in data centers and networking equipment. In Q4, we\nreturned capital to shareholders through $5.5 billion of share repurchase\nand $2.5 billion of dividend payments.\n\nTurning to our outlook. I would like to provide some commentary on factors\nthat will impact our business performance in the first quarter and full\nyear 2026. First, in terms of revenues, we're pleased with the overall\nmomentum of the business. At current spot rates, we would expect to see an\nFX tailwind to our consolidated revenues in Q1. However, the volatility in\nexchange rates could affect the impact of FX on Q1 revenues. In Google\nServices, we expect growth to be driven by ongoing innovation in the user\nexperience as well as improved ROI for advertisers, keeping in mind the\nnormal seasonal pattern for advertising revenue. In Google Cloud, we're\nseeing significant demand for our products and services, which we expect to\ncontinue to drive strong growth despite the tight supply environment we're\noperating in.\n\nMoving to investments. The investment we have been making in AI are already\ntranslating into strong performance across the business, as you've seen in\nour financial results. Our successful execution, coupled with strong\nperformance reinforces our conviction to make the investments required to\nfurther capitalize on the AI opportunity. For the full year 2026, we expect\nCapEx to be in the range of $175 billion to $185 billion with investments\nramping over the course of the year. We're investing in AI compute capacity\nto support Frontier model development by Google DeepMind, ongoing efforts\nto improve the user experience and drive higher advertiser ROI in Google\nServices, significant cloud customer demand as well as strategic\ninvestments in Other Bets. Keep in mind that the availability of supply,\npricing of components and timing of cash payments can cause some\nvariability in the reported CapEx number.\n\nIn terms of expenses, as we've discussed on previous calls, the significant\nincrease in our investments in technical infrastructure will continue to\nput pressure on the P&L in the form of higher depreciation expense and\nrelated data centers operations costs such as energy. In 2025, depreciation\nincreased by nearly $6 billion or 38% from $15.3 billion in 2024 to $21.1\nbillion in 2025. Given the increase in our CapEx investments in recent\nyears, we expect the growth rate in 2026 depreciation to accelerate in Q1\nand meaningfully increase for the full year. We're also planning to\ncontinue hiring in key investment areas such as AI and cloud. In 2025, our\nteams delivered amazing innovation, executing with a high level of\ndiscipline and velocity. These efforts provide great experiences for\nconsumers and outstanding performance for creators, partners and enterprise\ncustomers, driving strong revenue growth. I want to take this opportunity\nto thank our employees for their contribution to this impressive\nperformance.\nNow Sundar, Philipp and I will take your questions.",
  "qa_text": "Operator\n\n[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Brian Nowak with\nMorgan Stanley.\n\nBrian Thomas Nowak\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\n\nI have 2, one on agentic, one on YouTube. The first one on agentic. Sundar,\nI'd be curious to hear about as you look back at 2025, where do you think\nyou made the most progress on new types of agentic commerce products? And\nthen looking into '26, where are you most optimistic to sort of have even\nmore progress in utility for users and your advertisers? And the second one\nis on YouTube. We've seen a lot of the new content creation models like\nGenie, et cetera. Walk us through sort of the Alphabet long-term vision for\nhow Genie and some of these content creation tools could be integrated into\nYouTube over time.\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nGreat. Thanks. Thanks, Brian. First, maybe I'll take the agentic part\nfirst. I definitely think '25 was more about laying the foundation, getting\nthe models to start being more robust in agentic use cases. And obviously,\ncoding is an area where the progress was the most felt. In areas like\ncommerce, I think we spent the year working with the ecosystem to develop\nthe underlying protocol that's going to be needed for this agentic world.\nSo I think the launch of Universal Commerce Protocol at NRF in January with\na bunch of partners, founding partners, I think has been super well\nreceived. So I'm excited now that we have laid the foundation of\ninteroperability on which agentic commerce can work. And now we are\nintegrating those experiences into Gemini, AI Mode and so on. So I think\nthis is a year where you will see consumers actually being able to use all\nof this, and I'm excited about the opportunity ahead.\n\nOn YouTube, look, super excited by Genie and blown away by -- spent a lot\nof time creating this incredible worlds. I think it's going to have a wide\nlevel of applicability. I think an area where we shine in general is\nmultimodality and representing the real world. And I think Genie is a\nfurther step in that direction in terms of building world models. All the\ninnovation we are doing, be it a Imagen, Veo, Lyria, Genie, all that work\nwe bring in into our products and to our cloud customers. And YouTube is\ngoing to be a natural place for creators. We are going to keep\nincorporating these tools. Already creators are responding by adopting\nthese, but we do want to put creators at the center of the experience, and\nthat's very, very important to us. And so it's for us making sure YouTube\nis a voice for creator expression is the foundation by which we will\napproach this.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.\n\nEric James Sheridan\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\n\nTwo, if I could. Over the last couple of earnings calls, we've talked a lot\nabout imbalances between demand and capacity for AI, both internally and\nexternally. With the step function change in absolute capital dollars\nyou're projecting now in '26, can you talk about the pathway to closing the\ngaps or the need for compute, both internally and externally and how to\nthink about some of the outputs of closing that gap as the year progresses.\nAnd again, the second part would be against that level of spend that you're\nnow projecting for '26, how do you think about continuing to find operating\nefficiencies inside the business to fund those investment -- growth\ninvestments as well?\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Eric. You are right, and we've been supply constrained even as\nwe've been ramping up our capacity. Obviously, our CapEx spend this year is\nan eye towards the future. And you have to keep in mind some of the time\nhorizons that are increasing in the supply chain, et cetera. So we are\nconstantly planning for the long term and working towards that. And\nobviously, how we close the gap this year is a function of what we have\ndone in the prior years, right? And so there is that time delay to keep in\nmind. I expect the demand we are seeing across the board across our\nservices, what we need to invest for future work for Google DeepMind as\nwell as for cloud, I think, is exceptionally strong. And so I do expect to\ngo through the year in a supply-constrained way. And maybe Anat can touch\non the second part.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nYes. Sure. Thanks, Eric, for the question. I've mentioned on one of the\nprevious earnings call, our approach to how we look at efficiency and\nproductivity. And we don't view this as an episodic onetime project or\neffort, but rather how we run the business on a regular basis and always\nseek additional opportunities to drive efficiency across the business. And\ncertainly, with the demand we're seeing, whether it's from external\ncustomers or across the organization, the more capital we can free up\nwithin the organization to invest, the better we can turn this flywheel of\nmaking investments to drive future growth.\n\nAnd we're doing this across the organization, whether it's within our\ntechnical infrastructure, certainly, when we invest at these amounts, we\nlook at how we can ensure that we are the most efficient with every dollar\nthat goes towards our technical infrastructure. There are scientific\ninnovation that are part of that process, technical innovation, as you\nknow, and we've mentioned before, we primarily focus on construction of our\nown data centers. We do partner with some external parties on lease on\noccasion, but most of our data center, we can start ourselves, and we\nensure that we do it in the most efficient way in a way that matches our\nworkloads and our needs.\n\nWe look at coding productivity that Sundar mentioned in the past, our --\nabout 50% of our codes are written by agents, coding agents, which are then\nreviewed by our own engineers. But certainly, it helps our engineers do\nmore and move faster with the current footprint. We look at how we run the\nbusiness across the organization. So using AI within the business to drive\ndaily operations. It can be all the way from the engineering team to small\nteams within our back office, even within my finance team, for example, we\ndeployed agents within our treasury organization. We're deploying agents\nwithin how we run -- how we pay and reconcile invoice, et cetera. So there\nare opportunities across the business that we evaluate on a regular basis\nto ensure we can free up more of that capacity to invest in our future.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\n\nDouglas Till Anmuth\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nI have 2. Over the last couple of years, we've seen considerable large\nlanguage model leapfrogging and many expect that to continue. What are the\nways that Google can build and maintain its Gemini position around data and\ndistribution and product integration? And then how should we think about\nthe potential for TPUs to move outside of Google Cloud and into external\ndata centers and develop as an incremental revenue stream?\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nDoug, look, I think the LLM frontier, it's been an exciting trajectory. And\nI think 2026 will continue to show that progress. We are obviously\nimproving these models across many paradigms, right, on pretraining, post-\ntraining, test and compute and so on. And we are bringing multimodal models\ninto the picture. We are bringing agentic capabilities, the coding area is\nshowing a lot of progress. And obviously, integrating all of this together\nand offering a great customer experience for our -- to our products as well\nas through our APIs to our cloud customers. To me, it feels like there's a\nlot of headroom ahead. And as you've seen our trajectory over the past 2\nyears in terms of how we have been making progress.\n\nI think we are in a very, very relentless innovation cadence. And I think\nwe are confident about maintaining that momentum as we go through '26. In\nterms of TPUs, I would think about it as it's reflected in our overall part\nof what makes Google Cloud an attractive choice is the wide choice of\naccelerators we bring to bear here, and we meet customers in terms of what\ntheir needs are and the choice as well as other things we bring as part of\nGoogle Cloud, the end-to-end efficiencies in our data centers, all of that\ncomes to bear. And that's what you see in the strong momentum in Google\nCloud. And given the overall investment we are making, we expect to be able\nto drive that momentum there. So that's how I would think about it.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore.\n\nMark Stephen F. Mahaney\nEvercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division\n\nTwo questions. One, could you just comment a little bit on the YouTube ad\nrevenue, that 9% year-over-year growth? It sounded like direct response was\ngood. And it sounded like from search that retail came in relatively\nstrong. So it's a little surprising that didn't kind of come through in the\nYouTube ads revenue growth. And then Sundar, can I ask you to try to get\nahead of a debate in the market, which is there's kind of maybe at a\nDeepSeek moment again.\n\nYou talked earlier about Gemini being the AI engine for the most -- for\nsome of the most successful software SaaS companies out there in the world.\nAnd it just seems like there's a market belief that the software companies\nare kind of losing seat power, losing pricing power, and it looks like it\ncould be a really terrible customer base. I can't imagine that that's\nactually going to happen. But could you just talk about it? You're at the\nforefront of AI and the impact that that's having on software companies.\nWhy wouldn't that be or why would it be undermining the economics of your\nlarge software SaaS company base?\n\nPhilipp Schindler\nSenior Vice President & Chief Business Officer of Google\n\nSo Mark, so first of all, thank you for the question. For the full year\n2025, our YouTube's annual revenue surpassed $60 billion across ads and\nsubscription. In Q4, YouTube ads was driven indeed by strong growth in\ndirect response. On the brand side, as Anat shared, the largest factor\nnegatively impacting the year-over-year growth rate was lapping the strong\nspend on U.S. elections. We also saw a slight impact in some other brand-\nrelated verticals. But taking a step back, I think it's important to think\nabout YouTube ads and subs holistically because when a user shifts from\nbeing an ad-supported user to a YouTube Music and Premium customer, it has\na slightly negative impact on YouTube ads revenues, but a positive impact\non our business.\n\nAnd we had strong revenue growth in YouTube subscriptions this quarter,\nparticularly in the YouTube Music and Premium category. Maybe interesting\npart is what we're actually excited about our road map in brand, the\nopportunity on connected TVs, more innovative ad formats, for example, the\nshoppable mastheads I spoke about earlier that we piloted during Cyber 5.\nWe're working really, really hard to further connect brands and creators,\nscaling sponsorships and enabling advertisers to showcase their products,\ntheir services during high visibility spotlight moments.\n\nWe continue to expand the functionality of the creator partnership hub,\nmaking it a lot easier for brands to actually find creators and develop\ncampaigns. We're heavily focusing on brand deals on measurement efforts. So\nthere's a lot of interesting work in the pipeline. And on top of that, we\nactually see opportunity also for upside with performance advertising.\nThere's a lot of momentum with demand gen adoption across small and medium\nadvertisers. We're also excited about the opportunity for continued ads\ninnovation and direct response, like, for example, shoppable formats,\nincluding in the living room, which is then helping drive strength in\nretail, the continued momentum in Shorts and so on. So overall, we're quite\nexcited. Yes.\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nGreat. And Mark, on -- in terms of Gemini adoption and how -- what this\nmoment means for SaaS, et cetera. Look, at least from my vantage point, I\ndefinitely see we have very, very good SaaS customers who are leaders in\ntheir respective categories. And what I see the successful companies doing\nis they are definitely incorporating Gemini deeply in critical workflows,\nbe it on improving their product experience and driving growth or using it\nto drive efficiency within their organizations. And I think it is an\nenabling tool, just like it has been an enabling tool for us across our\nproducts and services, be it Search, YouTube, et cetera. I think the\ncompanies who are seizing the moment, I think, have the same opportunity\nahead. And at least we are excited about the partnerships we have there.\nAnd the momentum, if I look at it in terms of their tokens usage, et\ncetera, the growth has been very robust in Q4.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Mark Shmulik with AllianceBernstein.\n\nMark Elliott Shmulik\nBernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division\n\nTwo, if I may. The first for Anat is can you talk a little bit more about\nthe relationship between investment levels and how you kind of expect core\nperformance to trend? Is there like an operating income or a free cash flow\nobjective that you solve towards? Or how do you think about greenlighting\nresources and projects? And then the second question is for all of you. A\nyear ago, we probably could have guessed the answer to this question. But\ngiven where we are today, for each of you, what keeps you up at night here\nas you think about the Google story and what's next?\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Mark. Let me start with a question on the investment framework, and\nit's an important one. And as you can imagine, an important one for us as\nwell. We have a highly rigorous framework that we use internally where we\nlook at all the needs for investment, whether it's from our own\norganization or from external customers and have an estimate of what that\ninvestment could potentially yield, obviously, not just near term but long\nterm as well. So we take that into consideration when we make the following\ndecision. The first one is the total investment that we make across the\ncompany. This was, for example, in 2025, the $91 billion we invested in\nCapEx and our estimate for CapEx investment this year.\n\nSo what's the total envelope that we want to invest to ensure that we can\ndrive both near-term and long-term growth for the company. And then the\nsecond way we use that framework is to just allocate these funds across the\norganization, determine where we should make these investments. And\nthroughout the year, as you can imagine, we always look to understand where\nthings are moving, whether it's external dynamics or internal dynamics, and\nI've mentioned some of the supply chain pressures we're seeing externally.\nSo we look at this with a highly rigorous framework to make sure that we're\nmaking the right decision. It was exciting to see the fact that we're\nalready monetizing and you saw it in the results that we just issued this\nquarter, the investments that we've made in AI.\n\nIt's already delivering results across the business. I know it in cloud,\nit's very obvious external, but you've heard the comments on the success\nwe're seeing in search, the comments from Sundar and from Philipp and then\nthe Frontier model development that really serves as the foundation for the\norganization. We then also look at just the cash flow, cash flow generation\nand the health of our financials and the balance sheet. That's important as\nwell. So we take that into consideration when we make the decision about\nthe overall level of investment. We want to make sure we do it in a\nfiscally responsible way and that we invest appropriately, but we do it in\na way that maintains a very healthy financial position for the\norganization.\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nAnd yes, maybe I can answer on what keeps us up at night. Look, I think\noverall, we've been on this AI-first trajectory for over a decade now, and\nit's what we have been methodically thinking our way through. It's the\nreason why we've been working on TPUs for over a decade as an example. But\nI think specifically at this moment, maybe the top question is definitely\naround compute capacity, all the constraints, be it power, land, supply\nchain constraints, how do you ramp up to meet this extraordinary demand for\nthis moment, get our investments right for the long term and do it all in a\nway that we are driving efficiencies and doing it in a world-class way. And\nso that's where I think we are meeting the moment well and -- but it's\ndefinitely an area where we're spending a lot of time on.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.\n\nMichael Brian Nathanson\nMoffettNathanson LLC\n\nI have one for Sundar and one for Anat. Sundar, you mentioned the Universal\nCommerce Protocol a bunch of times. I wonder if you could spend some time\ntalking about the rationale for developing it, the opportunity that you see\nit solves for and what it means for the product discovery funnel for\nconsumers? And then for Anat, any color you can provide on the CapEx guide\nbetween longer duration assets like buildings and infrastructure and\nshorter cycle assets like technical equipment? That would be helpful.\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Michael. Obviously, people go through a lot of commercial journeys\nacross many of our surfaces, search, YouTube, Gemini app and so on. So I\nthink there's -- as well as we support through cloud and ads, our entire\nretail partners as well. And the opportunity to improve the experience, I\nthink, can be a kind of a huge foundational uplift here. But it's important\nto -- we are approaching it keeping in mind that our users as well as\nmerchants here and figuring out that value. Part of what's been good in\ndesigning the Universal Commerce Protocol is it makes it much easier for\nusers to complete transactions.\n\nBut at the same time, it allows merchants to help showcase the range of\ntheir offerings, if they want to make promotions, et cetera. So all of that\nis built into the protocol. And I think you have to get that value prop for\nthe ecosystem right to make the experience better. And so it's\nfoundational. And more importantly, we are now implementing the protocols\nand our Gemini models are making progress in those agentic capabilities.\nAnd I think -- so I'm excited about a future where as people are going\nthrough discovery, searching, finding new things, if they're interested in\nacting upon it, all of that is seamless. And so it overall creates an\nexpansionary moment.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nAnd the question with regards to the CapEx and the -- kind of what makes up\nthe total that we've announced for this year and last year, approximately\n60% of our investment in 2025, and it's going to be fairly similar in 2026,\nwent towards machines, so the servers. And then 40% is what you referred to\nas long-duration assets, which is our data centers and network and\nequipment. And I think you probably are referring to the depreciation delta\nbetween them. Those long-term duration assets depreciate over -- the\nbuilding could be 4 years or longer. Other components may be less than\nthat. Another important component is how we allocate this CapEx. And we've\ncommented in the past about the allocation of our ML compute across the\nbusiness. And for 2026, just over half of our ML compute is expected to go\ntowards the cloud business.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays.\n\nRoss Adam Sandler\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\n\nGreat. Just a question on the native Gemini 750 million. So we added 100\nmillion MAUs in the fourth quarter. Could you just talk high level about\nusage and retention of native Gemini? And is this 750 million the right way\nto measure your progress against companies like ChatGPT or is there another\ncohort of users that aren't in that 750 million that maybe we should also\nconsider?\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nRoss, I think we definitely saw, I would say, an extraordinary period of\ngrowth in Q4 for Gemini app. It's not just the growth in monthly active\nusers, but there's definitely -- there was a sharp increase in engagement\nper user on the app. So all the metrics be it active usage, the intensity\nof usage, retention all showed distinct progress across iOS, web, Android,\net cetera, and geographically globally. So definitely, all the product\nexperience improvements, the work we did with Nano Banana, the progress\nwith the Gemini models all translated into strong momentum and that\nmomentum is continuing. So we are excited about that, and we'll continue to\ninvest. Obviously, there are many people who are getting a deeply AI-native\nexperience in the context of AI mode in search as well. And we are\ndefinitely seeing strong growth and progress. And the introduction of\nGemini 3 in AI mode was a very positive driver as well. And obviously,\nwe'll continue to evolve these experiences, and I'm excited about the\nopportunities there.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo.\n\nKenneth James Gawrelski\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\n\nTwo, if I may, both on search. First, could you walk us through how you are\nevolving your views on the monetization of AI search activity given the\nmore conversational nature and longer periods of engagement per session,\nconsumer utility is increasingly driven by the on-platform results, not\nspecifically the linkouts and referrals. In that construct, how do you\nthink about increasing the revenue opportunity to match the consumer\nutility? And is this increasingly where premium subscriptions play? And\nthen question two, and it's related, as you think about partnerships such\nas the new Apple partnership on Siri, how do you think about the right way\nto align for success with those partners? Previously, as disclosed in the\nDOJ documents, et cetera, it was a revenue share relationship. But now if\nyou think about the utility that you're driving through AI search and\nthrough Gemini on those platforms, it may be less related to the actual\n'search revenue'. Could you just talk a little bit about how you align with\npartners for success there?\n\nPhilipp Schindler\nSenior Vice President & Chief Business Officer of Google\n\nSo first of all, it may be worthwhile to say that the acceleration we saw\nin search was not due to a single driver, but was really the result of many\ndifferent parts of our business showing strength and working well together.\nAnd maybe I quickly add the vertical perspective, retail, finance, health\ndrove actually the greatest contribution to search revenue, though nearly\nevery major vertical actually accelerated in Q4. More specifically to your\nquestion, the ongoing innovation is, as you know, core to what we do and\nthe enhancements to the user and the advertiser experience really continue\nto drive our performance, and we make hundreds of these changes every\nquarter.\n\nWe see AI Overviews and AI Mode continue to drive greater search usage and\ngrowth in overall queries, including important in commercial queries.\nGemini-based improvements in search ads help us better match queries and\ncraft creatives for advertisers. I talked about the understanding of intent\nand how this has significantly expanded our ability to deliver ads on\nlonger and more complex searches that were, frankly, previously difficult\nto monetize. AI Max, for example, is already used by hundreds of thousands\nof advertisers and continues to unlock billions of net new queries in that\nsense. We see strength with SMB advertisers expanding their budgets and\nadopting automation tools, leading to better ROI. On the creative side,\nwe're using Gemini to generate millions of creative assets via text\ncustomization in AI Max and PMax and so on. So we're very pleased with what\nwe're seeing here.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our last question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America.\n\nJustin Post\nBofA Securities, Research Division\n\nGreat. Just want to follow up on the Gemini app. Obviously, great growth\nthere. Are you seeing any cannibalization of search as far as activity as\npeople start using that app more? And then second, on monetization, where\nare you on that? And with agentic and other ads coming, could that be\nincremental to your growth over the next few years?\n\nSundar Pichai\nCEO & Director\n\nLook, right now, overall, look, I think we are giving people choice. People\nare obviously using search, experiencing AI Overviews and AI Mode as part\nof it and Gemini app as well. And the combination of all of that, I think,\ncreates an expansionary moment. I think it's expanding the type of queries\npeople do with Google overall. And so overall, some of it all is what we\nsee as a growth opportunity, and we haven't seen any evidence of\ncannibalization there. And maybe Philipp can comment on the monetization.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\nSenior Vice President & Chief Business Officer of Google\n\nYes. I think Sundar previously commented on agentic and how we think about\nit. And look, in general, as with all of our products, we really focus,\nfirst and foremost, on creating a great user experience, and we're very\nexcited about where we are with the ads and AI Overviews and early\nexperiments in AI Mode, including innovations like Direct Offers and our\nroad map for the future. In terms of the Gemini app today, we are focused\non our free tier and subscriptions and seeing great growth, as Sundar\ndiscussed. But ads have always been part of scaling products to reach\nbillions of people. And if done well, ads can be really valuable and\nhelpful commercial information. And at the right moment, we'll share any\nplans. But as we've said, we're not rushing anything here.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to\nturn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks.\n\nJames H. Friedland\nSenior Director of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with\nyou again on our first quarter 2026 call. Thank you, and have a good\nevening.\n\nOperatorThank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call.

      "text": "CEO & Director Thanks, Jim. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us. It was a tremendous quarter for Alphabet. The launch of Gemini 3 was a major milestone, and we have great momentum. Alphabet annual revenues exceeded $400 billion for the first time. This quarter, Search continued to accelerate with revenues growing 17%. YouTube's annual revenues surpassed $60 billion across ads and subscriptions. Cloud significantly accelerated with revenues growing 48%, now on an annual run rate of over $70 billion. Backlog grew by 55% quarter- over-quarter to $240 billion, representing a wide breadth of customers driven by demand for AI products. We have over 325 million paid subscriptions across consumer services with strong adoption for Google One and YouTube Premium. In addition, we have sold more than 8 million paid seats of Gemini Enterprise, which we launched just 4 months ago. And our Gemini app now has over 750 million monthly active users. We are also seeing significantly higher engagement per user, especially since the launch of Gemini 3 in December. Overall, we are seeing our AI investments and infrastructure drive revenue and growth across the board. To meet customer demand and capitalize on the growing opportunities ahead of us, our 2026 CapEx investments are anticipated to be in the range of $175 billion to $185 billion. Today, I'll provide an update on our AI progress and then share highlights from Search, Cloud, YouTube and Waymo. First, AI progress across the full stack. Our unrivaled infrastructure serves as the bedrock of our AI stack. We have the industry's widest variety of compute options. That includes GPUs from our partner, NVIDIA, who announced at CES, that we'll be among the first to offer their latest Vera Rubin GPU platform, plus our own TPUs that we have been developing for a decade. In December, we announced our intent to acquire Intersect, which provides data center and energy infrastructure solutions. As we scale, we are getting dramatically more efficient. We were able to lower Gemini serving unit cost by 78% over 2025 through model optimizations, efficiency and utilization improvements. Next, world-class AI research, including models and tooling. We offer the most extensive model portfolio in the world and lead across text, vision and image to video LMArena leaderboards. Gemini 3 Pro drives the state-of-the-art in reasoning and multimodal understanding. It has seen the fastest adoption of any model in our history. Since launch, Gemini 3 Pro has consistently processed 3x as many daily tokens on average as 2.5 Pro. Our latest model powers Google Antigravity, our new development platform where agents can autonomously plan and execute complex software tasks. It already has more than 1.5 million weekly active users after launching just over 2 months ago. Our first-party models like Gemini now process over 10 billion tokens per minute via direct API used by our customers, up from 7 billion last quarter. Third, bringing AI to our products and platforms. We are shipping innovation at scale to bring helpful AI features to people everywhere. In January alone, we have launched personal intelligence in AI mode in search and the Gemini app, introduced new features to Gmail an updated view, reimagine Chrome as an AI- first agentic browser through features like Chrome Auto Browse; announced Project Genie, which lets users create and explore interactive worlds generated in real time using Genie 3, our general purpose world model. And we laid the groundwork for shopping in the AI era by introducing a new open standard for agentic commerce, the universal commerce protocol built alongside many retail industry leaders. Finally, from Android to Pixel, we are getting our best AI capabilities into people's hands. At CES, a range of partners, including Samsung, showcased how they are bringing Gemini to more devices from XR to the living room and beyond. And to confirm the rumors, we'll be introducing our Pixel 10a to our best-ever-rated Pixel 10 series very soon. Turning now to key highlights from the quarter, starting with search. Search saw more usage in Q4 than ever before as AI continues to drive an expansionary moment. We have executed with incredible speed. We shipped over 250 product launches within AI Mode and AI Overviews just last quarter. We have integrated Gemini 3 directly into AI mode in search. Now search can better understand your query, dive deeper on the web and generate interactive UI experiences. And last week, we upgraded AI Overviews to Gemini 3, giving users a best-in-class AI response at the top of the search results page. We have also made the search experience more cohesive, ensuring the transition from an AI overview to a conversation in AI mode is completely seamless. These new experiences are proving to be more helpful and are driving greater usage. A few highlights. First, once people start using these new experiences, they use them more. In the U.S., we saw daily AI Mode queries per user double since launch and AI Overviews continue to perform very well. Second, people are engaging in longer, more complex sessions. Queries in AI Mode are 3x longer than traditional searches. We are also seeing sessions become more conversational with a significant portion of queries in AI Mode now leading to a follow-up question. Third, people are searching in new ways beyond text. Nearly 1 in 6 AI Mode queries are now nontext using voice or images. And Circle to Search is now available on over 580 million Android devices. Next, Google Cloud. Our growth in revenue, operating margin and backlog highlights the strength of our entire portfolio. One, we are winning more new customers faster. We exited the year with double the new customer velocity compared to Q1. Two, we are also signing larger customer commitments. The number of deals in 2025, over $1 billion surpassed the previous 3 years combined. And three, we continue to deepen our relationships with existing customers who are outpacing their initial commitments by over 30%. Nearly 75% of Google Cloud customers have used our vertically optimized AI from chips to models to AI platforms and enterprise AI agents, which offer superior performance, quality, security and cost efficiency. These AI customers use 1.8x as many products as those who do not, enabling us to diversify our product portfolio, deepen customer relationships and accelerate revenue growth. Our product line has multiple monetization levers spanning infrastructure, platform and high-margin AI-powered products and services with 14 product lines each exceeding $1 billion in annual revenue. We offer leading infrastructure for AI training and inference to our cloud customers with the industry's widest variety of compute options from our own seventh-generation Ironwood TPU to the latest NVIDIA GPUs. Our 10-year track record in building our own accelerators with expertise in chips, systems, networking and software translates to leading power and performance efficiency for large-scale inference and training. Our cloud AI accelerators serve the leading Frontier AI labs, capital markets firms like Citadel Securities, enterprises like Mercedes-Benz and governments for high-performance computing applications. We also offer our leading generative AI models, including Gemini, Imagen, Veo, Chirp and Lyria to cloud customers. In December alone, nearly 350 customers each processed more than 100 billion tokens. In Q4, revenue from products built on our generative AI models grew nearly 400% year-over-year, significantly accelerating from the prior quarter. Today, more than 120,000 enterprises use Gemini, including AI unicorns like Lovable and OpenEvidence and global enterprises like Airbus and Honeywell. 95% of the top 20 and over 80% of the top 100 SaaS companies use Gemini, including Salesforce and Shopify. Gemini is becoming the AI engine for the world's most successful software companies. Leading enterprises are also driving strong demand for our enterprise AI agents. We have sold more than 8 million paid seats of Gemini Enterprise, our enterprise AI platform to more than 2,800 companies, including BNY and Virgin Voyages to streamline knowledge management and automate processes. Gemini Enterprise managed over 5 billion customer interactions in Q4, growing 65% year-over-year for customers, including Wendy's, Kroger and Woolworths Group. Our integration of Gemini and Google Workspace is driving wins with global brands like Schwarz Group and public sector organizations like the U.S. Department of Transportation. We are also seeing momentum with independent software vendors. Revenue from AI solutions built by our partners increased nearly 300% year-over-year and commitments from our top 15 software partners grew more than 16x year-over-year. Before moving on, I'm pleased that we are collaborating with Apple as their preferred cloud provider and to develop the next generation of Apple Foundation Models based on Gemini technology. Up next, YouTube. I want to highlight 4 points. First, streaming. In the living room, YouTube continues to be the #1 streamer in the U.S. for nearly 3 years according to Nielsen. From the NFL to Coachella, YouTube is where people watch today's biggest popular culture moments unfold. Second, subscriptions. We continue to see strong subscription revenue growth across YouTube, particularly YouTube Music Premium. We'll soon launch new YouTube TV plans, bringing more choice and flexibility to subscribers with over 10 genre-specific packages. And the NFL has seen strong NFL Sunday Ticket subscriber growth with YouTube, with the highest paid subscriber number ever in the history of the product. Third, podcasts. To illustrate YouTube's popularity, in October 2025, viewers watched over 700 million hours of podcasts on living room devices, up 75% from just a year prior. And fourth, AI is transforming the YouTube experience for both creators and viewers. On average, every day in December, over 1 million channels used our new AI creation tools to supercharge their creativity. During that same month, more than 20 million viewers used our new Ask tool powered by Gemini to learn more about the content they watched. And finally, Waymo. This week, Waymo raised its largest investment round to date and is well positioned to continue its momentum with safety at the core. In December, we surpassed 20 million fully autonomous trips and are now providing more than 400,000 rides every week. Waymo continues to expand its service territory. Its sixth market, Miami, launched 2 weeks ago, and Waymo will soon expand its service to multiple cities across the U.S. and in the U.K. and Japan. The team has made incredible progress on important capabilities, including opening up public service to airports and freeways. In closing, 2025 was a fantastic year for the company. A big thanks to our employees and partners worldwide. We are really well positioned going into 2026. Now over to Philipp.",

      "text": "Senior Vice President & Chief Business Officer of Google Thanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. I'll cover performance for Google Services for the quarter, then structure the rest of my remarks around the great progress we're delivering across Search, YouTube and partnerships. Google Services revenues were $96 billion for the quarter, up 14% year-on- year, primarily driven by accelerated growth in search. Adding some further color to our results. The 17% increase in search and other was led by broad strength across all major verticals with retail particularly strong. On YouTube, the 9% growth in advertising revenues was driven by direct response. Network advertising revenues were down 2% year-on-year this quarter. Starting with search and other revenues, which delivered over $63 billion in revenue for the quarter. Sundar mentioned the expansionary moment for search. The same is true for ads. We're investing in AI to drive significant improvements across all areas of marketing. We're expanding the entire playing field that advertisers can compete on. AI gives businesses the ability to reach more customers in more places than ever before. Gemini uniquely positions us to bring the transformational benefits of AI to ads in 3 critical areas for our customers: ads quality, advertiser tools and new AI user experiences. First, ads quality. We've been deploying Gemini models to improve query understanding at a rate of almost a launch per month for the last 2 years. These improvements drive better query matching, ranking and quality, making search ads even more effective. With Gemini across our ads quality stack, we evaluate relevance with greater accuracy than with previous generations of models. This has significantly improved our ability to systematically deliver more helpful high-quality ads, contributing to a meaningful reduction in irrelevant ads served. Gemini's understanding of intent has increased our ability to deliver ads on longer, more complex searches that were previously challenging to monetize. Gemini models also have a significant impact on query understanding in non-English languages, expanding opportunities for businesses to scale globally. Second, we're building more agentic actions into our advertiser tools. Businesses can now leverage Gemini in conversational experiences within Ads and Analytics Advisor to identify and run recommended actions such as generating new campaigns. Advertisers use Gemini as a real-time partner to assemble creatives. In Q4 alone, they used Gemini to create nearly 70 million creative assets via text customization in AI Max and PMax. For instance, Aritzia, Canada's premier fashion house used AI Max to find new high-value customers that traditional strategies miss, delivering an 80% incremental uplift in conversion value for Q4. L'Oreal, one of the first alpha testers used AI Max in 2025 across 800 unique campaigns in 23 countries and 30 brands. AI Max enabled the L'Oreal Group to maximize its presence across the full consumer journey, fuel its consumer growth and increase revenue for DTC brands like NYX by 23%. The third area is how we monetize new AI user experiences in search. We have significantly increased our focus on AI mode and are in the early stages of experimenting with AI mode monetization like testing ads below the AI response with more underway. For example, we announced Direct Offers, a new Google Ads pilot, which will allow advertisers to show exclusive offers for shoppers who are ready to buy directly in AI mode. This new type of sponsored content uses AI to match the right offer provided by the retailer to the right user. As Sundar mentioned, we are building the era of agentic commerce and working with our partners to introduce the universal commerce protocol in our consumer products and across the web. We've received tremendous feedback from the industry. Soon, people can use a new checkout experience to buy directly in AI mode in Gemini from select merchants. Turning now to YouTube, which remains the #1 streamer in the U.S. for nearly 3 years according to Nielsen. YouTube creators are providing an unmatched breadth of content. Our investment in AI innovation across creativity, viewing experience and monetization continues to pay off. We're seeing strong traction in our subscription business, are innovating to meet consumers where they are. We added a new sports tier for YouTube TV at a lower price point. YouTube Premium Lite is proving to be a popular choice. And we continue to deliver strong year-on-year growth across YouTube subscriptions, particularly YouTube Music and Premium. Looking at monetization across YouTube, momentum continues in Shorts in the living room. Shorts now averages over 200 billion daily views. And as we've shared before, in a number of countries, Shorts earns more revenue per watch hour than traditional in-stream on YouTube, including the U.S. The retail vertical continues to grow, fueled by smaller advertisers increasingly adopting demand channel. Likewise, direct response continues to benefit from the momentum we're seeing with small- and medium-sized advertisers. Viewers trust product and brand recommendations from YouTube creators, and we are focused on making YouTube a premier shopping destination. Innovations like shoppable ad formats are improving advertiser return on investment. During Cyber 5, advertisers piloted shoppable mastheads, a new interactive ad format where viewers browse products and send links to their phones for an easy shopping experience. On brands, our creator partnership hub makes it easier for brands to find creators and develop campaigns. This holiday season, brands like JCPenney, Old Navy and Target worked with creators for their holiday campaigns. Mattel partnered with 8 top YouTube creators to reach families during the peak holiday shopping season in a campaign that helped drive a 25% increase in search volume for UNO. As always, I wrap with the progress we're seeing across partnerships where customers tap into the strength and breadth of Google's products to accelerate their transformation. I would start by joining Sundar in saying how pleased I am that we are collaborating with Apple as their preferred cloud provider and to develop the next generation of Apple Foundation Models based on Gemini technology. We partnered with Reliance Jio to provide over 500 million consumers with an 18-month free trial of our Gemini suite of products and 2 terabyte of cloud storage. Reliance Enterprise customers will also get access to Google Cloud's Gemini Enterprise and TPUs, bringing the best of Google AI to every employee and workflow. The Home Depot is applying Google AI across the board from cloud tools to AI-powered ads and YouTube creator partnerships that connect with the next generation off to us. Their investments in PMax and YouTube creator partnerships have resulted in double-digit increase in ad clicks and visits. In closing, I'd like to thank Googlers everywhere for their contributions to our success and as always, to our customers and partners for their continued trust. Anat, over to you.",

      "text": "Senior VP & CFO Thank you, Philipp. My comments will focus on year-over-year comparisons for the fourth quarter, unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level and will then cover segment results. I'll end with some commentary on our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2026. 2025 was a strong year of innovation and execution for Alphabet. These efforts, combined with our investments in AI, drove meaningful results across the business. For the full year 2025, Alphabet consolidated revenues were $403 billion, up 15% on a reported and constant currency basis. Moving to Q4 performance. We delivered strong growth in the fourth quarter. Consolidated revenues reached $113.8 billion, up 18% or 17% in constant currency and was driven by an acceleration in Search and Cloud revenues. Turning to costs and expenses. We reported a $2.1 billion stock-based compensation charge due to an increase in Waymo's valuation related to the investment round that was announced on Monday. The vast majority of the charge was reflected in R&D expenses. Total cost of revenue was $45.8 billion, up 13%. Tech was $16.6 billion, up 12%. Other cost of revenues was $29.2 billion, up 13%, with the increase primarily driven by depreciation associated with the deployment of our technical infrastructure, content acquisition costs largely for YouTube and other technical infrastructure operations costs. Total operating expenses were up 29% to $32.1 billion. R&D expense increased by 42%, driven by compensation and depreciation. The increase in compensation was due to the Waymo charge and investment in AI talent. Sales and marketing expenses were up 12%, primarily driven by marketing investments to support the Gemini app and Search. And G&A expenses increased 21%, primarily due to a shift in timing of our charitable contributions. Operating income increased 16% to $35.9 billion, and operating margin was 31.6%. Both operating income and operating margin were negatively impacted by the $2.1 billion Waymo charge in the quarter. Other income and expenses was $3.2 billion, primarily due to unrealized gains in our nonmarketable equity securities portfolio. Net income increased 30% to $34.5 billion and earnings per share increased 31% to $2.82. We generated record operating cash flow of $52.4 billion in the fourth quarter and $164.7 billion for the full year. This translated into $24.6 billion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter and $73.3 billion for the full year. We ended the quarter with $126.8 billion in cash and marketable securities and $46.5 billion in long-term debt. Turning to segment results. Google Services revenues increased 14% to $95.9 billion, reflecting strong growth in search and subscriptions. Google Search and other advertising revenues increased by 17% to $63.1 billion, representing another strong quarter with continued growth across all major verticals with the largest contribution from retail. YouTube advertising revenues increased 9% to $11.4 billion, driven by direct response advertising. Results were negatively affected from the lapping of the strong spend on U.S. election in the fourth quarter of 2024 that we've mentioned on previous earnings calls. Network advertising revenues of $7.8 billion were down 2%. Subscription platforms and devices revenues increased 17% this quarter to $13.6 billion due to strong growth in YouTube subscriptions, particularly YouTube Music and Premium and growth in Google One, which benefited from increased demand for AI plans. Google Services operating income increased 22% to $40.1 billion, and operating margins was 41.9%. The Google Cloud segment delivered outstanding results in the fourth quarter as the business continued to benefit from strong demand for our enterprise AI products. Cloud revenue accelerated meaningfully and were up 48% to $17.7 billion. Revenues were driven by strong performance in GCP, which continued to grow at a rate that was much higher than cloud's overall revenue growth rate. As Sundar noted, we're driving performance through strong growth in the win rate of new customers, signing larger customer commitments and increasing spend with existing customers. GCP's performance was driven by accelerating growth in enterprise AI products, which are generating billions in quarterly revenues. We had strong growth in both enterprise AI infrastructure, driven by deployment of TPUs and GPUs and enterprise AI solutions, which benefited from demand for our industry-leading models, including Gemini 3. Core GCP was also a meaningful contributor to growth due to strong demand for infrastructure and other services such as cybersecurity and data analytics. We also had double-digit growth in Workspace, driven by an increase in average revenue per seats and the number of seats. Cloud operating income was $5.3 billion, more than doubling year-over-year, and operating margin increased from 17.5% in the fourth quarter of last year to 30.1%. Google Cloud's backlog increased 55% sequentially and more than doubled year-over- year, reaching $240 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. The increase in backlog was driven by strong demand for our cloud products, led by our enterprise AI offerings from multiple customers. In Other Bets, revenues were $370 million, and operating loss was $3.6 billion, reflecting the $2.1 billion Waymo charge I mentioned earlier. We allocate resources in Other Bets to businesses like Waymo, where we see meaningful opportunities to create value. Alphabet funded a significant portion of the $16 billion investment round that Waymo announced on Monday, which will allow the business to accelerate its global expansion. CapEx was $27.9 billion for the fourth quarter and $91.4 billion for the full year, in line with our expectation. The vast majority of our CapEx was invested in technical infrastructure with approximately 60% of that investment in servers and 40% in data centers and networking equipment. In Q4, we returned capital to shareholders through $5.5 billion of share repurchase and $2.5 billion of dividend payments. Turning to our outlook. I would like to provide some commentary on factors that will impact our business performance in the first quarter and full year 2026. First, in terms of revenues, we're pleased with the overall momentum of the business. At current spot rates, we would expect to see an FX tailwind to our consolidated revenues in Q1. However, the volatility in exchange rates could affect the impact of FX on Q1 revenues. In Google Services, we expect growth to be driven by ongoing innovation in the user experience as well as improved ROI for advertisers, keeping in mind the normal seasonal pattern for advertising revenue. In Google Cloud, we're seeing significant demand for our products and services, which we expect to continue to drive strong growth despite the tight supply environment we're operating in. Moving to investments. The investment we have been making in AI are already translating into strong performance across the business, as you've seen in our financial results. Our successful execution, coupled with strong performance reinforces our conviction to make the investments required to further capitalize on the AI opportunity. For the full year 2026, we expect CapEx to be in the range of $175 billion to $185 billion with investments ramping over the course of the year. We're investing in AI compute capacity to support Frontier model development by Google DeepMind, ongoing efforts to improve the user experience and drive higher advertiser ROI in Google Services, significant cloud customer demand as well as strategic investments in Other Bets. Keep in mind that the availability of supply, pricing of components and timing of cash payments can cause some variability in the reported CapEx number. In terms of expenses, as we've discussed on previous calls, the significant increase in our investments in technical infrastructure will continue to put pressure on the P&L in the form of higher depreciation expense and related data centers operations costs such as energy. In 2025, depreciation increased by nearly $6 billion or 38% from $15.3 billion in 2024 to $21.1 billion in 2025. Given the increase in our CapEx investments in recent years, we expect the growth rate in 2026 depreciation to accelerate in Q1 and meaningfully increase for the full year. We're also planning to continue hiring in key investment areas such as AI and cloud. In 2025, our teams delivered amazing innovation, executing with a high level of discipline and velocity. These efforts provide great experiences for consumers and outstanding performance for creators, partners and enterprise customers, driving strong revenue growth. I want to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their contribution to this impressive performance. Now Sundar, Philipp and I will take your questions. Question and Answer",

And then looking into '26, where are you most optimistic to sort of have even more progress in utility for users and your advertisers? And the second one is on YouTube.

      "text": "CEO & Director Great. Thanks. Thanks, Brian. First, maybe I'll take the agentic part first. I definitely think '25 was more about laying the foundation, getting the models to start being more robust in agentic use cases. And obviously, coding is an area where the progress was the most felt. In areas like commerce, I think we spent the year working with the ecosystem to develop the underlying protocol that's going to be needed for this agentic world. So I think the launch of Universal Commerce Protocol at NRF in January with a bunch of partners, founding partners, I think has been super well received. So I'm excited now that we have laid the foundation of interoperability on which agentic commerce can work. And now we are integrating those experiences into Gemini, AI Mode and so on. So I think this is a year where you will see consumers actually being able to use all of this, and I'm excited about the opportunity ahead. On YouTube, look, super excited by Genie and blown away by -- spent a lot of time creating this incredible worlds. I think it's going to have a wide level of applicability. I think an area where we shine in general is multimodality and representing the real world. And I think Genie is a further step in that direction in terms of building world models. All the innovation we are doing, be it a Imagen, Veo, Lyria, Genie, all that work we bring in into our products and to our cloud customers. And YouTube is going to be a natural place for creators. We are going to keep incorporating these tools. Already creators are responding by adopting these, but we do want to put creators at the center of the experience, and that's very, very important to us. And so it's for us making sure YouTube is a voice for creator expression is the foundation by which we will approach this.",

So we are constantly planning for the long term and working towards that. And obviously, how we close the gap this year is a function of what we have done in the prior years, right? And so there is that time delay to keep in mind. I expect the demand we are seeing across the board across our services, what we need to invest for future work for Google DeepMind as well as for cloud, I think, is exceptionally strong.

      "text": "Senior VP & CFO Yes. Sure. Thanks, Eric, for the question. I've mentioned on one of the previous earnings call, our approach to how we look at efficiency and productivity. And we don't view this as an episodic onetime project or effort, but rather how we run the business on a regular basis and always seek additional opportunities to drive efficiency across the business. And certainly, with the demand we're seeing, whether it's from external customers or across the organization, the more capital we can free up within the organization to invest, the better we can turn this flywheel of making investments to drive future growth. And we're doing this across the organization, whether it's within our technical infrastructure, certainly, when we invest at these amounts, we look at how we can ensure that we are the most efficient with every dollar that goes towards our technical infrastructure. There are scientific innovation that are part of that process, technical innovation, as you know, and we've mentioned before, we primarily focus on construction of our own data centers. We do partner with some external parties on lease on occasion, but most of our data center, we can start ourselves, and we ensure that we do it in the most efficient way in a way that matches our workloads and our needs. We look at coding productivity that Sundar mentioned in the past, our -- about 50% of our codes are written by agents, coding agents, which are then reviewed by our own engineers. But certainly, it helps our engineers do more and move faster with the current footprint. We look at how we run the business across the organization. So using AI within the business to drive daily operations. It can be all the way from the engineering team to small teams within our back office, even within my finance team, for example, we deployed agents within our treasury organization. We're deploying agents within how we run -- how we pay and reconcile invoice, et cetera. So there are opportunities across the business that we evaluate on a regular basis to ensure we can free up more of that capacity to invest in our future.",

I think we are in a very, very relentless innovation cadence. And I think we are confident about maintaining that momentum as we go through '26. In terms of TPUs, I would think about it as it's reflected in our overall part of what makes Google Cloud an attractive choice is the wide choice of accelerators we bring to bear here, and we meet customers in terms of what their needs are and the choice as well as other things we bring as part of Google Cloud, the end-to-end efficiencies in our data centers, all of that comes to bear.

You talked earlier about Gemini being the AI engine for the most -- for some of the most successful software SaaS companies out there in the world. And it just seems like there's a market belief that the software companies are kind of losing seat power, losing pricing power, and it looks like it could be a really terrible customer base. I can't imagine that that's actually going to happen. But could you just talk about it? You're at the forefront of AI and the impact that that's having on software companies.

      "text": "Senior Vice President & Chief Business Officer of Google So Mark, so first of all, thank you for the question. For the full year 2025, our YouTube's annual revenue surpassed $60 billion across ads and subscription. In Q4, YouTube ads was driven indeed by strong growth in direct response. On the brand side, as Anat shared, the largest factor negatively impacting the year-over-year growth rate was lapping the strong spend on U.S. elections. We also saw a slight impact in some other brand- related verticals. But taking a step back, I think it's important to think about YouTube ads and subs holistically because when a user shifts from being an ad-supported user to a YouTube Music and Premium customer, it has a slightly negative impact on YouTube ads revenues, but a positive impact on our business. And we had strong revenue growth in YouTube subscriptions this quarter, particularly in the YouTube Music and Premium category. Maybe interesting part is what we're actually excited about our road map in brand, the opportunity on connected TVs, more innovative ad formats, for example, the shoppable mastheads I spoke about earlier that we piloted during Cyber 5. We're working really, really hard to further connect brands and creators, scaling sponsorships and enabling advertisers to showcase their products, their services during high visibility spotlight moments. We continue to expand the functionality of the creator partnership hub, making it a lot easier for brands to actually find creators and develop campaigns. We're heavily focusing on brand deals on measurement efforts. So there's a lot of interesting work in the pipeline. And on top of that, we actually see opportunity also for upside with performance advertising. There's a lot of momentum with demand gen adoption across small and medium advertisers. We're also excited about the opportunity for continued ads innovation and direct response, like, for example, shoppable formats, including in the living room, which is then helping drive strength in retail, the continued momentum in Shorts and so on.

      "text": "Senior VP & CFO Thanks, Mark. Let me start with a question on the investment framework, and it's an important one. And as you can imagine, an important one for us as well. We have a highly rigorous framework that we use internally where we look at all the needs for investment, whether it's from our own organization or from external customers and have an estimate of what that investment could potentially yield, obviously, not just near term but long term as well. So we take that into consideration when we make the following decision. The first one is the total investment that we make across the company. This was, for example, in 2025, the $91 billion we invested in CapEx and our estimate for CapEx investment this year. So what's the total envelope that we want to invest to ensure that we can drive both near-term and long-term growth for the company. And then the second way we use that framework is to just allocate these funds across the organization, determine where we should make these investments. And throughout the year, as you can imagine, we always look to understand where things are moving, whether it's external dynamics or internal dynamics, and I've mentioned some of the supply chain pressures we're seeing externally. So we look at this with a highly rigorous framework to make sure that we're making the right decision. It was exciting to see the fact that we're already monetizing and you saw it in the results that we just issued this quarter, the investments that we've made in AI. It's already delivering results across the business. I know it in cloud, it's very obvious external, but you've heard the comments on the success we're seeing in search, the comments from Sundar and from Philipp and then the Frontier model development that really serves as the foundation for the organization. We then also look at just the cash flow, cash flow generation and the health of our financials and the balance sheet. That's important as well. So we take that into consideration when we make the decision about the overall level of investment. We want to make sure we do it in a fiscally responsible way and that we invest appropriately, but we do it in a way that maintains a very healthy financial position for the organization.",

Look, I think overall, we've been on this AI-first trajectory for over a decade now, and it's what we have been methodically thinking our way through. It's the reason why we've been working on TPUs for over a decade as an example. But I think specifically at this moment, maybe the top question is definitely around compute capacity, all the constraints, be it power, land, supply chain constraints, how do you ramp up to meet this extraordinary demand for this moment, get our investments right for the long term and do it all in a way that we are driving efficiencies and doing it in a world-class way. And so that's where I think we are meeting the moment well and -- but it's definitely an area where we're spending a lot of time on.",

Sundar, you mentioned the Universal Commerce Protocol a bunch of times. I wonder if you could spend some time talking about the rationale for developing it, the opportunity that you see it solves for and what it means for the product discovery funnel for consumers? And then for Anat, any color you can provide on the CapEx guide between longer duration assets like buildings and infrastructure and shorter cycle assets like technical equipment? That would be helpful.",

So I think there's -- as well as we support through cloud and ads, our entire retail partners as well. And the opportunity to improve the experience, I think, can be a kind of a huge foundational uplift here. But it's important to -- we are approaching it keeping in mind that our users as well as merchants here and figuring out that value. Part of what's been good in designing the Universal Commerce Protocol is it makes it much easier for users to complete transactions. But at the same time, it allows merchants to help showcase the range of their offerings, if they want to make promotions, et cetera. So all of that is built into the protocol. And I think you have to get that value prop for the ecosystem right to make the experience better. And so it's foundational. And more importantly, we are now implementing the protocols and our Gemini models are making progress in those agentic capabilities. And I think -- so I'm excited about a future where as people are going through discovery, searching, finding new things, if they're interested in acting upon it, all of that is seamless. And so it overall creates an expansionary moment.",

And then 40% is what you referred to as long-duration assets, which is our data centers and network and equipment. And I think you probably are referring to the depreciation delta between them. Those long-term duration assets depreciate over -- the building could be 4 years or longer. Other components may be less than that. Another important component is how we allocate this CapEx. And we've commented in the past about the allocation of our ML compute across the business. And for 2026, just over half of our ML compute is expected to go towards the cloud business.",

So definitely, all the product experience improvements, the work we did with Nano Banana, the progress with the Gemini models all translated into strong momentum and that momentum is continuing. So we are excited about that, and we'll continue to invest. Obviously, there are many people who are getting a deeply AI-native experience in the context of AI mode in search as well. And we are definitely seeing strong growth and progress. And the introduction of Gemini 3 in AI mode was a very positive driver as well. And obviously, we'll continue to evolve these experiences, and I'm excited about the opportunities there.",

First, could you walk us through how you are evolving your views on the monetization of AI search activity given the more conversational nature and longer periods of engagement per session, consumer utility is increasingly driven by the on-platform results, not specifically the linkouts and referrals. In that construct, how do you think about increasing the revenue opportunity to match the consumer utility? And is this increasingly where premium subscriptions play? And then question two, and it's related, as you think about partnerships such as the new Apple partnership on Siri, how do you think about the right way to align for success with those partners? Previously, as disclosed in the DOJ documents, et cetera, it was a revenue share relationship. But now if you think about the utility that you're driving through AI search and through Gemini on those platforms, it may be less related to the actual 'search revenue'. Could you just talk a little bit about how you align with partners for success there?",

And maybe I quickly add the vertical perspective, retail, finance, health drove actually the greatest contribution to search revenue, though nearly every major vertical actually accelerated in Q4. More specifically to your question, the ongoing innovation is, as you know, core to what we do and the enhancements to the user and the advertiser experience really continue to drive our performance, and we make hundreds of these changes every quarter. We see AI Overviews and AI Mode continue to drive greater search usage and growth in overall queries, including important in commercial queries. Gemini-based improvements in search ads help us better match queries and craft creatives for advertisers. I talked about the understanding of intent and how this has significantly expanded our ability to deliver ads on longer and more complex searches that were, frankly, previously difficult to monetize. AI Max, for example, is already used by hundreds of thousands of advertisers and continues to unlock billions of net new queries in that sense. We see strength with SMB advertisers expanding their budgets and adopting automation tools, leading to better ROI. On the creative side, we're using Gemini to generate millions of creative assets via text customization in AI Max and PMax and so on. So we're very pleased with what we're seeing here.",
