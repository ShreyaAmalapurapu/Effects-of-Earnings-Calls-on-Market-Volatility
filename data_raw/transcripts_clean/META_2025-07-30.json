NasdaqGS:META\nFQ2 2025 Earnings Call Transcripts\nWednesday, July 30, 2025 9:00 PM GMT\nS&P Global Market Intelligence Estimates\n\nPresentation\n\nOperator\n\nGood afternoon. My name is Krista, and I will be your conference operator\ntoday. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Meta Second\nQuarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And this call\nwill be recorded. Thank you very much.\n\nKenneth Dorell, Meta's Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nKenneth J. Dorell\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Meta's Second Quarter 2025\nEarnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; and\nSusan Li, CFO.\n\nOur remarks today will include forward-looking statements, which are based\non assumptions as of today. Actual results may differ materially as a\nresult of various factors, including those set forth in today's earnings\npress release and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.\nWe undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.\n\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial\nmeasures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in\ntoday's earnings press release. The earnings press release and an\naccompanying investor presentation are available on our website at\ninvestor.atmeta.com.\n\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nAll right. Thanks, Ken. Thanks, everyone, for joining today. We had another\nstrong quarter with more than 3.4 billion people using at least one of our\napps each day and strong engagement across the board. Our business\ncontinues to perform very well, which enables us to invest heavily in our\nAI efforts.\n\nOver the last few months, we've begun to see glimpses of our AI systems\nimproving themselves. And the improvement is slow for now, but undeniable\nand developing superintelligence, which we define as AI that surpasses\nhuman intelligence in every way, we think, is now in sight. Meta's vision\nis to bring personal superintelligence to everyone, so that people can\ndirect it towards what they value in their own lives. And we believe that\nthis has the potential to begin an exciting new era of individual\nempowerment.\n\nA lot has been written about all the economic and scientific advances that\nsuperintelligence can bring, and I'm extremely optimistic about this. But I\nthink that if history is a guide, then an even more important role will be\nhow superintelligence empowers people to be more creative, develop culture\nand communities, connect with each other and lead more fulfilling lives.\n\nTo build this future, we've established Meta Superintelligence Labs, which\nincludes our foundations, product and FAIR teams as well as a new lab that\nis focused on developing the next generation of our models. We're making\ngood progress towards Llama 4.1 and 4.2, and in parallel, we are also\nworking on our next generation of models that will push the frontier in the\nnext year or so.\n\nWe are building an elite, talent-dense team Alexandr Wang is leading the\noverall team, Nat Friedman is leading our AI Products and Applied Research,\nand Shengjia Zhao is Chief Scientist for the new effort. They are all\nincredibly talented leaders, and I'm excited to work closely with them and\nthe world-class group of AI researchers and infrastructure and data\nengineers that we're assembling.\n\nI've spent a lot of time building this team this quarter. And the reason\nthat so many people are excited to join is because Meta has all of the\ningredients that are required to build leading models and deliver them to\nbillions of people. The people who are joining us are going to have access\nto unparalleled compute as we build out several multi-gigawatt clusters.\nOur Prometheus cluster is coming online next year, and we think it's going\nto be the world's first gigawatt-plus cluster. We're also building out\nHyperion, which will be able to scale up to 5 gigawatts over several years,\nand we have multiple more titan clusters in development as well. We are\nmaking all these investments because we have conviction that\nsuperintelligence is going to improve every aspect of what we do.\n\nFrom a business perspective, I mentioned last quarter that there are five\nbasic opportunities that we are pursuing, improved advertising, more\nengaging experiences, business messaging, Meta AI and AI devices. So I can\ngo into a bit of detail on each.\n\nOn advertising, the strong performance this quarter is largely thanks to AI\nunlocking greater efficiency and gains across our ad system. This quarter,\nwe expanded our new AI-powered recommendation model for ads to new surfaces\nand improved its performance by using more signals and longer context. It's\ndriven roughly 5% more ad conversions on Instagram and 3% on Facebook.\n\nWe're also seeing good progress with AI for ad creative with a meaningful\npercent of our ad revenue now coming from campaigns using one of our\ngenerative AI features. This is going to be especially valuable for smaller\nadvertisers with limited budgets. While agencies will continue the\nimportant work to help larger brands apply these tools strategically.\n\nThe second opportunity is more engaging experiences. AI is significantly\nimproving our ability to show people content that they're going to find\ninteresting and useful. Advancements in our recommendation systems have\nimproved quality so much that it has led to a 5% increase in time spent on\nFacebook and 6% on Instagram, just this quarter. There is a lot of\npotential for content itself to get better too, we're seeing early progress\nwith the launch of our AI video editing tools across Meta AI and our new\nEdits app. And there's a lot more to do here.\n\nThe third opportunity is business messaging. I've talked before about how I\nbelieve every business will soon have a business AI, just like they have an\ne-mail address, social media account and website. We are starting to see\nsome product market fit in a number of countries where we're testing these\nagents, and we're integrating these business AIs into ads on Facebook and\nInstagram as well as directly into e-commerce websites.\n\nThe fourth opportunity is Meta AI. Its reach is already quite impressive\nwith more than 1 billion monthly actives. Our focus is now deepening the\nexperience and making Meta AI the leading personal AI. As we continue\nimproving our models, we see engagement grow. So our next generation of\nmodels is going to continue to really help here.\n\nAnd the fifth opportunity is AI devices. We continue to see strong momentum\nwith our Ray-Ban Meta glasses with sales accelerating. We are also\nlaunching new performance AI glasses with the Oakley Meta HSTN, they have\nlonger battery life, higher resolution camera and are designed for sports.\nThe percent of people using Meta AI is growing, and we are seeing new users\nAI retention increase too, which is a good sign for that continued use.\n\nI think that AI glasses are going to be the main way that we integrate\nsuperintelligence into our day-to-day lives. So it's important to have all\nof these different styles and products that appeal to different people in\ndifferent settings.\n\nFinally, we're seeing people continue to spend more time with our Quest\necosystem and the community continues to grow steadily. We launched the\nMeta Quest 3S Xbox Edition last month, and we're seeing record interest in\ncloud gaming. And beyond gaming, we continue to see a broader set of use\ncases with media and web browsing contributing a significant portion of\nengagement.\n\nWe're going to have more to share on all of this, especially the Reality\nLabs work at Connect on September 17. So I encourage you all to tune into\nthat.\n\nOverall, this has been a busy quarter. Strong business performance and real\nmomentum in assembling both the talent and the compute that we need to\nbuild personal superintelligence for everyone. I am very grateful to our\nteams who are working hard to deliver all of this, and thanks to all of you\nfor being on this journey with us.\n\nAnd now here is Susan.\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our\nconsolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless\notherwise noted.\n\nQ2 total revenue was $47.5 billion, up 22% on both a reported and constant\ncurrency basis. Q2 total expenses were $27.1 billion, up 12% compared to\nlast year. In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased\n16%, driven mostly by higher infrastructure costs and payments to partners,\npartially offset by a benefit from the previously announced extension of\nsever useful lives.\n\nR&D increased 23%, mostly due to higher employee compensation and\ninfrastructure costs. Marketing and sales increased 9% primarily due to an\nincrease in professional services related to our ongoing platform integrity\nefforts as well as marketing costs, partially offset by lower employee\ncompensation. G&A decreased 27%, driven mostly by lower legal-related\ncosts.\n\nWe ended Q2 with over 75,900 employees, down 1% quarter-over-quarter, as\nthe vast majority of the employees impacted by performance-related\nreductions earlier this year were no longer captured in our head count.\nThis was partially offset by continued hiring in priority areas of\nmonetization, infrastructure, Reality Labs, AI as well as regulation and\ncompliance.\n\nSecond quarter operating income was $20.4 billion, representing a 43%\noperating margin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 11%, which reflects\nexcess tax benefits from share-based compensation due to the increase in\nour share price versus prior periods.\n\nNet income was $18.3 billion or $7.14 per share. Capital expenditures,\nincluding principal payments on finance leases were $17 billion, driven by\ninvestments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure.\n\nFree cash flow was $8.5 billion. We repurchased $9.8 billion of our Class A\ncommon stock and paid $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders. We also\nmade $15.1 billion in nonmarketable equity investments in the second\nquarter which includes our minority investment in Scale AI, along with\nother investment activities. We ended the quarter with $47.1 billion in\ncash and marketable securities and $28.8 billion in debt.\n\nMoving now to our segment results. I'll begin with our Family of Apps\nsegment. Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow, and we\nestimate more than 3.4 billion people used at least one of our Family of\nApps on a daily basis in June. Q2 total Family of Apps revenue was $47.1\nbillion, up 22% year-over-year. Q2 Family of Apps ad revenue was $46.6\nbillion, up 21% or 22% on a constant currency basis. Within that revenue,\nthe online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year\ngrowth.\n\nOn a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Europe and\nRest of World at 24% and 23%, respectively. North America and Asia Pacific\ngrew 21% and 18%.\n\nIn Q2, the total number of ad impressions served across our services\nincreased 11%, with growth mainly driven by Asia Pacific. Impression growth\naccelerated across all regions due primarily to engagement tailwinds on\nboth Facebook and Instagram and to a lesser extent, ad load optimizations\non Facebook.\n\nThe average price per ad increased 9%, benefiting from increased advertiser\ndemand, largely driven by improved ad performance. Pricing growth slowed\nmodestly from the first quarter due to the accelerated impression growth in\nQ2.\n\nFamily of Apps other revenue was $583 million, up 50%, driven by WhatsApp\npaid messaging revenue growth as well as Meta Verified subscriptions. We\ncontinue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development\nand operation of our Family of Apps.\n\nIn Q2, Family of Apps expenses were $22.2 billion, representing 82% of our\noverall expenses. Family of Apps expenses were up 14% and mainly due to\ngrowth in employee compensation and infrastructure costs, partially offset\nby lower legal-related costs.\n\nFamily of Apps operating income was $25 billion, representing a 53%\noperating margin.\n\nWithin our Reality Labs segment, Q2 revenue was $370 million up 5% year-\nover-year due to increased sales of AI glasses, partially offset by lower\nQuest sales. Reality Labs expenses were $4.9 billion, up 1% year-over-year,\ndriven by higher non-head count-related technology development costs.\nReality Labs operating loss was $4.5 billion.\n\nTurning now to the business outlook. There are two primary factors that\ndrive our revenue performance, our ability to deliver engaging experiences\nfor our community and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over\ntime.\n\nOn the first, daily actives continue to grow across Facebook, Instagram and\nWhatsApp as we make additional improvements to our recommendation systems\nand product experiences. We continue to see momentum with video engagement,\nin particular. In Q2, Instagram video time was up more than 20% year-over-\nyear globally. We're seeing strong traction on Facebook as well,\nparticularly in the U.S., where video time spent similarly expanded more\nthan 20% year-over-year. These gains have been enabled by ongoing\noptimizations to our ranking systems to better identify the most relevant\ncontent to show.\n\nWe expect to deliver additional improvements throughout the year as we\nfurther scale up our models and make recommendations more adaptive to a\nperson's interests within their session.\n\nAnother emphasis of our recommendations work is promoting original content.\nOn Instagram, over 2/3 of recommended content in the U.S. now comes from\noriginal posts. In the second half, we'll be focused on further increasing\nthe freshness of original posts, so the right audiences can discover\noriginal content from creators soon after it is posted.\n\nWe are also making good progress on our longer-term ranking innovations\nthat we expect will provide the next leg of improvements over the coming\nyears. Our research efforts to develop cross-surface foundation\nrecommendation models continue to progress. We are also seeing promising\nresults from using LLM in Threads recommendation systems. The incorporation\nof LLMs are now driving a meaningful share of the ranking related time\nspent gains on Threads.\n\nWe're now exploring how to extend the use of LLMs and recommendation\nsystems to our other apps. We're leveraging Llama and several other back-\nend processes as well, including actioning bug reports so we can identify\nand resolve recurring issues more quickly and efficiently. This has\nresulted in top line bug reports in the U.S. and Canada in Facebook Feed\nand notifications dropping by roughly 30% over the past 10 months.\n\nThe primary way we're using Llama in our apps today is to power Meta AI\nwhich is now available in over 200 countries and territories. WhatsApp\ncontinues to be the largest driver of queries as people message Meta AI\ndirectly for tasks such as information gathering, homework assistance and\ngenerating images. Outside of WhatsApp, we're seeing Meta AI become an\nincreasingly valuable complement to our content discovery engines. Meta AI\nusage on Facebook is expanding as people use it to ask about posts they see\nin Feed and find content across our platform in Search.\n\nAnother way we expect Meta AI will help with content discovery is through\nthe automatic translation and dubbing of foreign language content into the\naudience's local language. We'll have more to share on our efforts there\nlater this year.\n\nMoving to Reality Labs. The growth of Ray-Ban Meta sales accelerated in Q2,\nwith demand still outstripping supply for the most popular SKUs despite\nincreases to our production earlier this year. We're working to ramp supply\nto better meet consumer demand later this year.\n\nNow to the second driver of our revenue performance, increasing\nmonetization efficiency. The first part of this work is optimizing the\nlevel of ads within organic engagement. We continue to optimize ad supply\nacross each surface to better deliver ads at the time and place they are\nmost relevant to people. In Q2, we also began introducing ads within Feed\non Threads and the Updates tab of WhatsApp, which is a separate space away\nfrom people's chats.\n\nAs of May, advertisers globally can now run video and image ads to Threads\nusers in most countries, including the United States. While ad supply\nremains low and Threads is not expected to be a meaningful contributor to\noverall impression growth in the near term, we are optimistic about the\nlonger-term opportunity with Threads as the community and engagement grow\nand monetization scales.\n\nOn WhatsApp, we are rolling out ads in status and channels, along with\nchannel subscriptions in the Updates tab to help businesses reach the more\nthan 1.5 billion daily actives who visit that part of the app. We expect\nthe introduction of ads and status will be gradual over the course of this\nyear and next, with low levels of expected ad supply initially.\n\nWe also expect WhatsApp ads and status to earn a lower average price than\nFacebook or Instagram ads for the foreseeable future, due in part towards\nWhatsApp skew toward lower monetizing markets, and more limited information\nthat can be used for targeting. Given this, we do not expect ads and status\nto be a meaningful contributor to total impressions or revenue growth for\nthe next few years.\n\nThe second part of increasing monetization efficiency is improving\nmarketing performance. There are three areas of this work that I'll focus\non today, improving our ad systems, advancing our ads products, including\nby building tools that assist in ads creation and evolving our ads platform\nto drive results that are optimized for each business' objectives.\n\nFirst is our ad systems where we're innovating in both the ads retrieval\nand ranking stages to serve more relevant ads to people. A lot of this work\ninvolves us continuing to advance the modeling innovations we've introduced\npreviously while expanding their adoption across our platform.\n\nThe Andromeda model architecture we began introducing in the second half of\n2024 powers the ads retrieval stage of our ad system, where we select the\nfew thousand most relevant ads from tens of millions of potential\ncandidates. In Q2, we made enhancements to Andromeda that enabled it to\nselect more relevant and more personalized ads candidates while also\nexpanding coverage to Facebook Reels. These improvements have driven nearly\n4% higher conversions on Facebook Mobile Feed and Reels.\n\nOur new Generative Ads Recommendation system, or GEM, powers the ranking\nstage of our ad system, which is the part of the process after ads\nretrieval where we determine which ads to show someone from candidates\nsuggested by our retrieval engine. In Q2, we improved the performance of\nGEM by further scaling our training capacity and adding organic and ads\nengagement data on Instagram. We also incorporated new advanced sequence\nmodeling techniques that helped us double the length of event sequences we\nuse, enabling our systems to consider a longer history of the content or\nads that a person has engaged with in order to provide better ad\nselections.\n\nThe combination of these improvements increased ad conversions by\napproximately 5% on Instagram and 3% on Facebook Feed and Reels in Q2.\n\nFinally, we expanded coverage of our Lattice model architecture in Q2. We\nfirst began deploying Lattice in 2023 with our later-stage ads ranking\nefforts, allowing us to run significantly larger models that generalize\nlearnings across objectives and surfaces in place of numerous smaller ads\nmodels that have historically been optimized for individual objectives and\nsurfaces.\n\nIn April, we began deploying Lattice to earlier-stage ads ranking models as\nwell. This is leading not only to greater capacity and engineering\nefficiency but also improved performance with the recent Lattice\ndeployments driving a nearly 4% increase in ad conversions across Facebook\nFeed and Reels in Q2.\n\nNext, ad products. Here, we're seeing strong momentum with our Advantage+\nsuite of AI-powered solutions. In Q2, we completed the rollout of our\nstreamlined campaign creation flow for Advantage+ sales and app campaigns,\nwhich makes it easier for advertisers to realize the performance benefits\nfrom Advantage+ by having it turned on at the beginning. We've seen lifts\nin advertiser adoption of sales and app campaigns since we've expanded\navailability and are working to complete the rollout for leads campaigns in\nthe coming months.\n\nWithin our Advantage+ Creative suite, adoption of genAI ad creative tools\ncontinues to broaden. Nearly 2 million advertisers are now using our video\ngeneration features, image animation and video expansion, and we're seeing\nstrong results with our text generation tools as we continue to add new\nfeatures.\n\nIn Q2, we started testing AI-powered translation so that advertisers can\nautomatically translate the caption of their ads to 10 different languages.\nWhile it's early, we have seen promising performance lifts in our prelaunch\ntests.\n\nWe're also continuing to see strong adoption of image expansion among small-\n and medium-sized advertisers, which speaks to how these tools help\nbusinesses who have fewer resources to develop creative. With larger\nadvertisers, we expect agencies will continue to be valuable partners in\nhelping apply these new tools to drive performance.\n\nOutside of Advantage+, we're seeing good momentum in business messaging,\nparticularly in the U.S., where click to message revenue grew more than 40%\nyear-over-year in Q2. The strong U.S. growth is benefiting from a ramp in\nadoption of our website to message ads, which drive people to a business's\nwebsite for more information before choosing to launch a chat with the\nbusiness in one of our messaging apps.\n\nFinally, we continue to evolve our ads platform to drive results that are\noptimized for each business' objectives and the way they measure results.\nIn Q2, we completed the global rollout of our incremental attribution\nfeature, which is the only product on the market that optimizes for and\nreports on incremental conversions, which are conversions that would not\nhave happened without a person seeing the ad.\n\nWe also launched omnichannel ads globally in Q2 and which enable\nadvertisers to optimize for incremental sales, both in-store and online\nwith just one campaign. In tests, advertisers using omnichannel ads have\nseen a median 15% reduction in total cost per purchase compared to website-\nonly optimization.\n\nNext, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. Our\nprimary focus remains investing capital back into the business with\ninfrastructure and talent being our top priorities.\n\nI'll start with hiring. Our approach to adding head count continues to be\ntargeted at the company's highest priority areas. We expect talent\nadditions across all of our priority areas will continue to drive overall\nhead count growth through this year and 2026. While head count growth in\nour other functions remains constrained, within AI, we've had a particular\nemphasis on recruiting leading talent within the industry, as we build out\nMeta Superintelligence Labs to accelerate our AI model development and\nproduct initiatives.\n\nNext, infrastructure. We expect having sufficient compute capacity will be\ncentral to realizing many of the largest opportunities in front of us over\nthe coming years. We continue to see very compelling returns from our AI\ncapacity investments in our core ads and organic engagement initiatives and\nexpect to continue investing significantly there in 2026.\n\nWe also expect that developing leading AI infrastructure will be a core\nadvantage in developing the best AI models and product experiences. So we\nexpect to ramp our investments significantly in 2026 to support that work.\n\nMoving to our financial outlook. We expect third quarter 2025 total revenue\nto be in the range of $47.5 billion to $50.5 billion. Our guidance assumes\nforeign currency is an approximately 1% tailwind to year-over-year total\nrevenue growth, based on current exchange rates. While we are not providing\nan outlook for fourth quarter revenue, we would expect our year-over-year\ngrowth rate in the fourth quarter of 2025 to be slower than the third\nquarter as we lap a period of stronger growth in the fourth quarter of\n2024.\n\nTurning now to the expense outlook. We expect full year 2025 total expenses\nto be in the range of $114 billion to $118 billion, narrowed from our prior\noutlook of $113 billion to $118 billion and reflecting a growth rate of 20%\nto 24% year-over-year.\n\nWhile we're still very early in planning for next year, there are a few\nfactors we expect will provide meaningful upward pressure on our 2026 total\nexpense growth rate. The largest single driver of growth will be\ninfrastructure costs, driven by a sharp acceleration in depreciation\nexpense growth and higher operating costs as we continue to scale up our\ninfrastructure fleet. Aside from infrastructure, we expect the second\nlargest driver of growth to be employee compensation as we add technical\ntalent in priority areas and recognize a full year of compensation expenses\nfor employees hired throughout 2025. We expect these factors will result in\na 2026 year-over-year expense growth rate that is above the 2025 expense\ngrowth rate.\n\nTurning now to the CapEx outlook. We currently expect 2025 capital\nexpenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to be in the\nrange of $66 billion to $72 billion, narrowed from our prior outlook of $64\nbillion to $72 billion and up approximately $30 billion year-over-year at\nthe midpoint. While the infrastructure planning process remains highly\ndynamic, we currently expect another year of similarly significant CapEx\ndollar growth in 2026 as we continue aggressively pursuing opportunities to\nbring additional capacity online to meet the needs of our AI efforts and\nbusiness operations.\n\nOn to tax. With the enactment of the new U.S. tax law, we anticipate a\nreduction in our U.S. federal cash tax for the remainder of the current\nyear and future years. There are several alternative ways of implementing\nthe provisions of the act, which we are currently evaluating. While we\nestimate that the 2025 tax rate will be higher than our Q2 tax rate, we\ncannot quantify the magnitude at this time.\n\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape,\nincluding the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU that\ncould significantly impact our business and our financial results. For\nexample, we continue to engage with the European Commission on our Less\nPersonalized Ads offering or LPA, which we introduced in November 2024 and\nbased on feedback from the European Commission in connection with the DMA.\n\nAs the commission provides further feedback on LPA, we cannot rule out that\nit may seek to impose further modifications to it that would result in a\nmaterially worse user and advertiser experience. This could have a\nsignificant negative impact on our European revenue as early as later this\nquarter. We have appealed the European Commission's DMA decision, but any\nmodifications to our model may be imposed during the appeal process.\n\nIn closing, this was another strong quarter for our business as our\ninvestments in infrastructure and technical talent continue to improve core\nads performance and engagement on our platforms. We expect the significant\ninvestments we're making now will allow us to continue leveraging advances\nin AI to extend those gains and unlock a new set of opportunities in the\nyears to come.\nWith that, Krista, let's open up the call for questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Eric\nSheridan with Goldman Sachs.\n\nEric James Sheridan\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\n\nMark, when you think about where the AI parts of your business have been\nevolving over the last 3 to 6 months, I wanted to know what your key\nlearnings were as you went deep into that strategy that informed some of\nthe shifts in both talent, acquisition and compute, coupled with some of\nthe blogs you put out recently in terms of how that strategy might have\nevolved based on those key learnings?\n\nAnd Susan, building on Mark's comments on scaling talent and compute, I\nwant to know if you go a little bit deeper on how we should be thinking\nabout those two components driving some of the commentary you've given\naround OpEx and CapEx over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nYes, sure. I can start. At a high level, I think that there are all these\nquestions that people have about what are going to be the time lines to get\nto really strong AI or superintelligence or whatever you want to call it.\nAnd I guess that each step along the way so far, we've observed the more\nkind of aggressive assumptions, or the fastest assumptions have been the\nones that have most accurately predicted what would happen. And I think\nthat, that just continued to happen over the course of this year, too.\n\nAnd so I've given a number of those anecdotes on these earnings calls in\nthe past. And I think, certainly, some of the work that we're seeing with\nteams internally being able to adapt Llama 4 to build autonomous AI agents\nthat can help improve the Facebook algorithm to increase quality and\nengagement are like -- I mean, that's like a fairly profound thing if you\nthink about it. I mean it's happening in low volume right now. So I'm not\nsure that, that result by itself was a major contributor to this quarter's\nearnings or anything like that. But I think the trajectory on this stuff is\nvery optimistic.\n\nAnd I think it's one of the interesting challenges in running a business\nlike this now is there's just a very high chance it seems like the world is\ngoing to look pretty different in a few years from now. And on the one\nhand, there are all these things that we can do, there are improvements to\nour core products that exist.\n\nAnd then I think we have this principle that we believe in across the\ncompany, which we tell people take superintelligence seriously. And the\nbasic principle is this idea that we think that this is going to really\nshape all of our systems sooner rather than later, not necessarily on the\ntrajectory of a quarter or 2, but on the trajectory of a few years. And I\nthink that that's just going to change a lot of the assumptions around how\ndifferent things work across the company.\n\nSo anyway, I think it's basically just what we're continually observing how\nthis works and what the trajectory or the pace of AI progress has been. I\nthink it continues to be on the faster end. And that I think informs a lot\nof the decisions from everything from the importance and value of having\nthe absolute best and most elite talent-dense team at the company to making\nsure that we have a leading compute fleet so that the people here can do --\nobviously, the researchers here have more compute per person to be able to\nlead their research and then roll it out to billions of people across our\nproducts, making sure that we build and drive these products through all of\nthe different things that we do, which I think is one of the things that\nour company is the best in the world at is basically when we take a\ntechnology, we're good at driving that through all of our apps and our ad\nsystems and all that stuff, it's not just going to kind of sit on the vine.\n\nI think that there's no other company, I think that is as good as us at\nkind of taking something and kind of getting it in front of billions of\npeople. So yes, I mean, we're just going to push very aggressively on all\nof that. But at some level, yes, this is -- there's sort of a bet in the\ntrajectory that we're seeing and those are the signals that we're seeing.\nBut we're just trying to read it.\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nEric, for the second part of your question, we haven't, in fact, kicked off\nour budgeting process for 2026. So thinking about next year, there are\nclearly many, many moving pieces in a very dynamic operating environment.\nBut there are certain aspects that we have some visibility into today,\nincluding the rough shape of our 2026 infrastructure plans. And that flows\nthrough into our expense expectations next year. And we also have some\nvisibility into the compensation expense growth that we'll recognize from\nthe AI talent that we're hiring this year. And so those two things are part\nof why we gave a little bit of an early preview into the expectations for\ngrowth for 2026 total expenses as well as for 2026 CapEx.\n\nSo on the total expenses side, as I mentioned, we expect infrastructure\nwill be the single largest contributor to 2026 expense growth. That's\ndriven primarily by a sharp acceleration in depreciation expense growth in\n2026, largely driven by recognizing incremental depreciation from assets\nthat we purchased and place in service in '26 as well as from\ninfrastructure deployed through 2025 that will recognize a full year of\ndepreciation next year. We also expect a greater mix of our CapEx to be in\nshorter-lived assets in 2025 and '26 than it has been in prior years.\n\nAnd then the other component of infra cost growth next year would come from\nhigher operating expenses, including energy costs, leases, maintenance and\noperational expenses that are associated with maintaining that fleet. And\nwe also expect some increased spend on cloud services in '26 to meet our\ncapacity needs as well as growth in network-related costs.\n\nSo a lot going on, on the infrastructure side as it contributes to the 2026\ntotal expense number. After that, employee compensation is the next largest\ndriver of expense growth in '26. Again, driven primarily in the investments\nthat we're making in technical talent, including recognizing a full year of\ncompensation expense for the AI talent we hire this year.\n\nI realize this answer is getting a little long, so I'll try to wrap up\nquickly. On the CapEx side, the big driver of our increased CapEx in '26\nwill be scaling genAI capacity as we build out training capacity that's\ngoing to drive higher spend across servers, networking, data centers next\nyear. We also expect that we're going to continue investing significantly\nin core AI in 2026. And again, this is a pretty -- a very dynamic area of\nplanning, but we wanted to share kind of our early thoughts as things are\nshaping up.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\n\nBrian Thomas Nowak\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\n\nI have two. The first one, Mark, just to kind of go back to the\nintelligence labs and sort of the vision for superintelligence. As you sort\nof sit here now versus 12 months ago, can you just sort of walk us through\nany changes of technological constraints or technological gating factors\nthat you are most focused on overcoming in the next 24 months that may have\nbeen different than they were in the past, just to make sure you can really\nlead in the idea of superintelligence over the next 10 years?\n\nAnd then the second one to Susan or Mark, one on the core. You've made so\nmany improvements to the core to drive higher engagement, recommendations,\net cetera. Can you just walk us through a couple of the factors you're\nstill most excited about to come in the next 18 months that you think could\ndrive a further lift to engagement on the core platform?\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nYes, sure. I mean in terms of the research agenda and a bunch of the areas\nthat we're very focused on, I do think focusing on self-improvement is a\nvery important area of research. And there's obviously different scaling\nparadigms, and I don't want to get too much into the detail of research\nthat we're doing on this. But I think that for developing\nsuperintelligence, at some level, you're not just going to be learning from\npeople because you're trying to build something that is fundamentally\nsmarter than people. So it's going to need to learn how to -- or you're\ngoing to need to develop a way for it to be able to improve itself.\n\nSo that, I think, is a very fundamental thing. That is going to have a very\nbroad implications for how we build products, how we run the company, new\nthings that we can invent, new discoveries that can be made, society more\nbroadly. I think that that's just a very fundamental part of this.\n\nIn terms of the shape of the effort overall, I guess I've just gotten a\nlittle bit more convinced around the ability for small talent-dense teams\nto be the optimal configuration for driving frontier research. And it's a\nbit of a different setup than we have on our other world-class machine\nlearning system.\n\nSo if you look at like what we do in Instagram or Facebook or our ad\nsystem, we can very productively have many hundreds or thousands of people\nbasically working on improving those systems, and we have very well-\ndeveloped systems for kind of individuals to run tests and be able to test\na bunch of different things. You don't need every researcher there to have\nthe whole system in their head. But I think for this -- for the leading\nresearch on superintelligence, you really want the smallest group that can\nhold the whole thing in their head, which drives, I think, some of the\nphysics around the team size and how -- and the dynamics around how that\nworks.\n\nBut I'll hand it over to Susan to talk about more of the practical stuff.\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nBrian, on the sort of forward-looking road map for the core recommendation\nengine. There are a handful of shorter-term things that we're focused on in\nthe near term. One is we're focused on making recommendations even more\nadaptive to what a person is engaging with during their session so that the\nrecommendations we surface are the most relevant to what they're interested\nin at that moment. And we're making optimizations to help the best content\nfrom smaller creators break-out by matching it to the right audiences\nsooner after it gets posted.\n\nAnd we're also working on improving the ability for our systems to discover\nmore diversified and niche interest for each person through interest\nexploration and learning explicit user preferences. We're also planning to\nscale up our models further and incorporate more advanced techniques that\nshould improve the overall quality of recommendations.\n\nBut we also have a lot of long-term bets in the hopper around areas like\ndeveloping foundational models that will support recommendations across\nmultiple services. Incorporating LLMs more deeply into our recommendation\nsystems. And a big focus of this work is going to be on optimizing the\nsystems to make them more efficient. So that we can continue to scale up\nthe capacity that we use for our recommendation systems without eroding the\nROI that we deliver.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\n\nDouglas Till Anmuth\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nOne for Mark and one for Susan. Mark, Meta has been a huge proponent of\nopen source AI, has your thinking changed here at all, just as you pursue\nsuperintelligence and push for even greater returns on your significant\ninfrastructure investments?\n\nAnd then, Susan, your comments on '26 CapEx suggest more than $100 billion\nof spend next year potentially. Do you continue to expect to finance all\nthis yourself? Or could there be opportunities to partner here?\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nYes. I mean on open source, I don't think that our thinking has\nparticularly changed on this. We've always open sourced some of our models\nand not open sourced everything that we've done. So I would expect that we\nwill continue to produce and share leading open source models.\n\nI also think that there are a couple of trends that are playing out. One is\nthat we're getting models that are so big that they're just not practical\nfor a lot of other people to use. So it's -- we would kind of wrestle with\nwhether it's productive or helpful to share that or if that's really just\nprimarily helping competitors or something like that. So I think that\nthere's that concern. And then obviously, as you approach real\nsuperintelligence, I think there is a whole different set of safety\nconcerns that I think we need to take very seriously, that I wrote about in\nmy note this morning.\n\nBut I think the bottom line is, I would expect that we will continue open\nsourcing work. I expect us to continue to be a leader there. And I also\nexpect us to continue to not open source everything that we do, which is a\ncontinuation of kind of what we've been kind of working on.\n\nAnd yes, I mean, I think Susan will talk a little bit more about the\ninfrastructure, but it really is a massive investment. We think it will be\ngood over time. But we do take very seriously that this is a just massive\namount of capital to convert into many gigawatts of compute which we think\nis going to help us produce leading research and quality products and in\nrunning the business, I do look for opportunities to basically convert\ncapital into quality of products that we can deliver for people. But this\nis certainly a massive bet that we're kind of -- we're focused on, and we\nwant to make sure that what we build accrues to building the best products\nthat we can deliver to the billions of people who use our services.\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nDoug, on your second question about how we expect to finance the growing\nCapEx next year. We certainly expect that we will finance some large share\nof that ourselves, but we're also exploring ways to work with financial\npartners to co-develop data centers. We don't have any finalized\ntransactions to announce, but we generally believe that there will be\nmodels here that will attract significant external financing to support\nlarge-scale data center projects that are developed using our ability to\nbuild world-class infrastructure while providing us with flexibility should\nour infrastructure requirements change over time. So we are exploring many\ndifferent paths.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.\n\nJustin Post\nBofA Securities, Research Division\n\nI'll ask another one on infrastructure. Mark, your spend is now approaching\nsome of the biggest hyperscalers out there. Do you think of all this\ncapacity mostly for internal uses? Or do you think there's a way to share\nor even come up with a business model where leveraging that capacity for\nexternal uses?\n\nAnd then Susan, when you think about the ROI on this CapEx, I'm sure you\nhave internal models, I'm sure you can't share all that, but how are you\nthinking about the ROI? And are you optimistic about the long-term returns?\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nJustin, I can go ahead and take a crack at both of those. And obviously,\nMark, you should feel free to weigh in.\n\nRight now, we are focused on ensuring that we have enough capacity for our\ninternal use cases, which includes both all of the core AI work that we do\nto support the recommendation engine work on the organic content side to\nsupport all the ads ranking and recommendation work. And then, of course,\nto make sure that we are building the training capacity that we think we\nneed in order to build frontier AI models. And to make sure that we're\npreparing ourselves for the types of inference use cases that we think\nmight -- that we might have ahead of us as we eventually focus not only on\ndeveloping frontier models, but also how we can expand into the kinds of\nconsumer use cases that we think will be hopefully widely useful and\nengaging for our users.\n\nSo at present, we're not really thinking about external use cases on the\ninfrastructure, but it's a good question.\n\nOn your second question, which is really around the sort of ROI on CapEx,\nthere are a couple of things. So again, on the core AI side, we continue to\nsee strong ROI. Our ability to measure that is quite good, and we feel sort\nof very good about the rigorous measurement and returns that we see there.\n\nOn the genAI side, we are clearly much, much earlier on the return curve\nand we don't expect that the genAI work is going to be a meaningful driver\nof revenue this year or next year. But we remain generally very optimistic\nabout the monetization opportunities that will open up, and Mark spoke to\nthem in his script, the sort of five pillars, so I won't repeat them here.\nAnd we think that over the medium- to long-term time frame, those are\nopportunities that are very adjacent and intuitive for where -- in terms of\nwhere our business is today, why they would be big opportunities for us and\nthat there will be sort of big markets attached to each of them.\n\nSo we, again, are also, I would say -- the last thing I would add here is\nwe are building the infrastructure with fungibility in mind. Obviously,\nthere are a lot of things that you have to build up front in terms of the\ndata center shells, the networking infrastructure, et cetera. But we will\nbe ordering servers, which ultimately will be the biggest bulk of CapEx\nspend as we need them and when we need them and making sort of the best\ndecisions at those times in terms of figuring out where the capacity will\ngo to use.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Shmulik with Bernstein.\n\nMark Elliott Shmulik\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\n\nMark, as you go after the superintelligence vision, especially for those of\nus on the outside, what are kind of some of the markers or KPIs that you're\ntracking on whether you're on track and making progress? Is it really\nagainst kind of those five pillars you outlined above? Or should we be\nthinking more broadly?\n\nAnd Susan, obviously AI delivering great ROI today, all those investments\nand also building towards kind of longer-term goals, just curious, has\nthere just been any change or adjustment to how you think about the\nrelationship between revenues or core business performance and the cadence\nof investment?\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nYes, in terms of what to look at, I mean, what I'm going to look at\ninternally, the quality of the people on the teams, the quality of the\nmodels that we're producing, the rate of improvement of our other AI\nsystems across the company and the extent to which the leading kind of\nfoundation models that we're building contribute to improving all of the\nother AI systems and kind of everything that we're doing around the\ncompany.\n\nThen I think you just get into our standard product and business playbook,\nwhich is translating that technology into new products, which will first\nscale to billions of people and then over time, we will monetize. But I\nthink that there's going to be some lag in that, right? And that, I think,\nis kind of always the way that we work is, whether we're building some new\nsocial product or this, something like Meta AI or a new product around\nthis, we're going to work on getting to leading scale, building the highest\nquality product, focused on that for a few years. And then once we're\nreally confident in that position, then we'll focus on ramping up the\nbusiness around it.\n\nSo it's -- I mean, going back to the last question a little bit, it's sort\nof when you compare this business to some of the cloud businesses, it's\nlike we do have this delay where we focus on building research and then\ndoing research and then ramping consumer products, and it often does take\nsome period of time before we really are ramping up the business around it.\nI think that's kind of a known property of our business and the cycle\naround it.\n\nBut I guess, on the flip side, we believe that if you are building\nsuperintelligence, you should use all of your GPUs to make it so that\nyou're serving your customers really well with that. And we think that\nthere's going to be a much higher return than we can do by generating that\ndirectly rather than just kind of renting or leasing out the infrastructure\nat other companies.\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nOn the second part of your question, we've said in the past that our\nprimary focus from a profitability perspective is driving consolidated\noperating profit growth over time. And it won't be linear. In some years,\nwe'll deliver above-average profit growth. And in years where we're making\nbig investments, I think we will see that impact the amount of operating\nprofit growth that we can deliver.\n\nAnd at the moment, we see a lot of attractive investment opportunities that\nwe believe are going to set us up to deliver compelling profit growth in\nthe coming years for all of our investors. And so we're focused on\nconstraining investments elsewhere as we pursue those investments. But we\nreally believe that this is a time for us to really make investments in the\nfuture of AI as I think it will open up both new opportunities for us in\naddition to strengthen our core business.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citi.\n\nRonald Victor Josey\nCitigroup Inc., Research Division\n\nMark, I wanted to ask you on Meta AI, and I think you talked about in the\ncall just growing engagement overall, particularly on WhatsApp. And now we\nhave 1 billion users on the platform and the focus is now on driving\npersonalization. So I want to understand a little bit more how these next-\ngen models can help drive adoption here, particularly with Behemoth coming\nonline at some point.\n\nAnd then as people are using that Meta AI with WhatsApp, thoughts on search\nand queries and potentially monetizing that.\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nYes, I'm not going to get super deep into the road map on this, but the\nbasic -- we do see that as we continue improving the models behind Meta AI\nand post training and just engagement increases and as we swap in the\nupdated models, when we go from Llama 4 to Llama 4.1 when we have that, we\nexpect that just -- the models are inherently pretty general. So it's --\nyes, you focus on specific areas, but in general, it just sort of gets\nbetter at a lot of different things that people want to ask it or want to\ndo with it. And I think with each version, both like what we're doing on a\nweek-to-week basis in terms of continuing to train it, and when we drop\nkind of new generations or big dot releases of each generation, that will\nimprove engagement, too.\n\nSo we're focused on that. I'm not going to go into the specific research\nareas or capabilities that we're planning on dropping in the future. But\nobviously, I'm pretty excited about it.\n\nOperator\n\nThe last question comes from the line of use of Youssef Squali with Truist\nSecurities.\n\nYoussef Houssaini Squali\nTruist Securities, Inc., Research Division\n\nI have two. So Mark, the Ray-Ban initiative has been a [ hallmark ] for you\nguys so far. Where are we on the development of glasses? And has that new\ncomputational platform that you've talked about in the past, is it moving\nfaster or slower than you thought? And as you leverage Meta AI, do you\nbelieve glasses ultimately replace smartphones? Or do you need the new form\nfactor that's AI first?\n\nAnd then, Susan, just quickly, how do you guys see SBC progressing over the\nnext couple of years? Is it fair to assume it will grow materially faster\nthan the revenue and OpEx? And how do you minimize shareholder dilution?\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nYes, I can talk a bit about the glasses. Yes, I mean, I'm very excited\nabout the progress that we're making. I think both the Ray-Ban Metas and\nI'm very excited about the Oakley Meta, the HSTNs too. And other things\nthat we have planned. Yes, I mean, this product category is clearly doing\nquite well. And I think it's good for a lot of things. It is stylish\neyewear, so people like wearing them just as glasses. It has a bunch of\ninteresting functionality. And then the use of Meta AI in them just\ncontinues to grow, and the percent of people who are using it for that on a\ndaily basis is increasing, and that's all good to see.\n\nI mean, I continue to think that glasses are basically going to be the\nideal form factor for AI because you can let an AI see what you see\nthroughout the day, hear what you hear, talk to you. Once you get a display\nin there, whether it's the kind of wide holographic field of view like we\nshowed with Orion or just a smaller display that might be good for\ndisplaying some information, and that's also going to unlock a lot of value\nwhere you can just interact with an AI system throughout the day in this\nmultimodal way. It can see the content around you, it can generate a UI for\nyou, show you information and be helpful.\n\nI mean, I personally think that just like if -- I wear contact lenses, I\nfeel like if I didn't have my vision corrected, I'd be sort of at a\ncognitive disadvantage going through the world. And I think in the future,\nif you don't have glasses that have AI or some way to interact with AI, I\nthink you're kind of similarly, probably be at a pretty significant\ncognitive disadvantage compared to other people and who you're working\nwith, or competing against.\n\nSo I think that this is a pretty fundamental form factor. There are a lot\nof different versions of it. Right now, we're building ones that I think\nare stylish, but aren't focused on the display. I think there's a whole set\nof different things to explore with displays. This is kind of what we've\nbeen maxing out with Reality Labs over the last 5 to 10 years is basically\ndoing the research on all of these different things.\n\nAnd it's a -- I don't know, 10 years ago, I would have -- like the other\nthing that's awesome about glasses is, they are going to be the ideal way\nto blend the physical and digital worlds together. So the whole metaverse\nvision, I think, is going to end up being extremely important, too, and AI\nis going to accelerate that, too.\n\nIt -- just that if you'd asked me 5 years ago, whether we'd have kind of\nholograms that created immersive experiences or superintelligence first, I\nthink most people would have thought that you'd get the holograms first.\nAnd it's this interesting kind of quirk of the tech industry that I think\nwe're going to end up having really strong AI first. But because we've been\ninvesting in this, I think we're just several years ahead on building out\nglasses. And I think that that's something that we're excited to keep on\ninvesting in heavily because I think it's going to be a really important\npart of the future.\n\nKenneth J. Dorell\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nYoussef, we didn't quite get your second question, do you mind just\nrepeating it?\n\nYoussef Houssaini Squali\nTruist Securities, Inc., Research Division\n\nSure. Just as you look at the spend on stock-based compensation over the\nnext couple of years with all these hires, I'm assuming that we're going to\nsee that materially -- or grow materially faster maybe than revenue and\nOpEx. And I just want to know how -- what you guys are doing to plan to\nminimize shareholder dilution. Is it mostly buybacks or anything else?\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Youssef. So I mean, the impact of the sort of increased\ncompensation costs, including SBC, of our AI hires this year is reflected\nin the revised 2025 expense outlook and in the -- the comments I made about\nsort of 2026 expense outlook. Those are obviously a big driver of 2026\nexpense growth as we recognize the full year of compensation for the\nadditional talent we're bringing on.\n\nHaving said that, so we factored that into our sort of expense outlook.\nHaving said that, we certainly -- we are very focused on making sure on\nkeeping an eye on dilution. And we generally believe that our strong\nfinancial position is going to allow us to support these investments while\ncontinuing to repurchase shares as part of the sort of buyback program that\noffsets equity compensation and as well as provide quarterly cash dividend\ndistributions to our investors.\n\nKenneth J. Dorell\nDirector of Investor RelationsGreat. Thank you, everyone, for joining us\ntoday.

  "presentation_text": "Operator\n\nGood afternoon. My name is Krista, and I will be your conference operator\ntoday. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Meta Second\nQuarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And this call\nwill be recorded. Thank you very much.\n\nKenneth Dorell, Meta's Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nKenneth J. Dorell\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Meta's Second Quarter 2025\nEarnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; and\nSusan Li, CFO.\n\nOur remarks today will include forward-looking statements, which are based\non assumptions as of today. Actual results may differ materially as a\nresult of various factors, including those set forth in today's earnings\npress release and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.\nWe undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.\n\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial\nmeasures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in\ntoday's earnings press release. The earnings press release and an\naccompanying investor presentation are available on our website at\ninvestor.atmeta.com.\n\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nAll right. Thanks, Ken. Thanks, everyone, for joining today. We had another\nstrong quarter with more than 3.4 billion people using at least one of our\napps each day and strong engagement across the board. Our business\ncontinues to perform very well, which enables us to invest heavily in our\nAI efforts.\n\nOver the last few months, we've begun to see glimpses of our AI systems\nimproving themselves. And the improvement is slow for now, but undeniable\nand developing superintelligence, which we define as AI that surpasses\nhuman intelligence in every way, we think, is now in sight. Meta's vision\nis to bring personal superintelligence to everyone, so that people can\ndirect it towards what they value in their own lives. And we believe that\nthis has the potential to begin an exciting new era of individual\nempowerment.\n\nA lot has been written about all the economic and scientific advances that\nsuperintelligence can bring, and I'm extremely optimistic about this. But I\nthink that if history is a guide, then an even more important role will be\nhow superintelligence empowers people to be more creative, develop culture\nand communities, connect with each other and lead more fulfilling lives.\n\nTo build this future, we've established Meta Superintelligence Labs, which\nincludes our foundations, product and FAIR teams as well as a new lab that\nis focused on developing the next generation of our models. We're making\ngood progress towards Llama 4.1 and 4.2, and in parallel, we are also\nworking on our next generation of models that will push the frontier in the\nnext year or so.\n\nWe are building an elite, talent-dense team Alexandr Wang is leading the\noverall team, Nat Friedman is leading our AI Products and Applied Research,\nand Shengjia Zhao is Chief Scientist for the new effort. They are all\nincredibly talented leaders, and I'm excited to work closely with them and\nthe world-class group of AI researchers and infrastructure and data\nengineers that we're assembling.\n\nI've spent a lot of time building this team this quarter. And the reason\nthat so many people are excited to join is because Meta has all of the\ningredients that are required to build leading models and deliver them to\nbillions of people. The people who are joining us are going to have access\nto unparalleled compute as we build out several multi-gigawatt clusters.\nOur Prometheus cluster is coming online next year, and we think it's going\nto be the world's first gigawatt-plus cluster. We're also building out\nHyperion, which will be able to scale up to 5 gigawatts over several years,\nand we have multiple more titan clusters in development as well. We are\nmaking all these investments because we have conviction that\nsuperintelligence is going to improve every aspect of what we do.\n\nFrom a business perspective, I mentioned last quarter that there are five\nbasic opportunities that we are pursuing, improved advertising, more\nengaging experiences, business messaging, Meta AI and AI devices. So I can\ngo into a bit of detail on each.\n\nOn advertising, the strong performance this quarter is largely thanks to AI\nunlocking greater efficiency and gains across our ad system. This quarter,\nwe expanded our new AI-powered recommendation model for ads to new surfaces\nand improved its performance by using more signals and longer context. It's\ndriven roughly 5% more ad conversions on Instagram and 3% on Facebook.\n\nWe're also seeing good progress with AI for ad creative with a meaningful\npercent of our ad revenue now coming from campaigns using one of our\ngenerative AI features. This is going to be especially valuable for smaller\nadvertisers with limited budgets. While agencies will continue the\nimportant work to help larger brands apply these tools strategically.\n\nThe second opportunity is more engaging experiences. AI is significantly\nimproving our ability to show people content that they're going to find\ninteresting and useful. Advancements in our recommendation systems have\nimproved quality so much that it has led to a 5% increase in time spent on\nFacebook and 6% on Instagram, just this quarter. There is a lot of\npotential for content itself to get better too, we're seeing early progress\nwith the launch of our AI video editing tools across Meta AI and our new\nEdits app. And there's a lot more to do here.\n\nThe third opportunity is business messaging. I've talked before about how I\nbelieve every business will soon have a business AI, just like they have an\ne-mail address, social media account and website. We are starting to see\nsome product market fit in a number of countries where we're testing these\nagents, and we're integrating these business AIs into ads on Facebook and\nInstagram as well as directly into e-commerce websites.\n\nThe fourth opportunity is Meta AI. Its reach is already quite impressive\nwith more than 1 billion monthly actives. Our focus is now deepening the\nexperience and making Meta AI the leading personal AI. As we continue\nimproving our models, we see engagement grow. So our next generation of\nmodels is going to continue to really help here.\n\nAnd the fifth opportunity is AI devices. We continue to see strong momentum\nwith our Ray-Ban Meta glasses with sales accelerating. We are also\nlaunching new performance AI glasses with the Oakley Meta HSTN, they have\nlonger battery life, higher resolution camera and are designed for sports.\nThe percent of people using Meta AI is growing, and we are seeing new users\nAI retention increase too, which is a good sign for that continued use.\n\nI think that AI glasses are going to be the main way that we integrate\nsuperintelligence into our day-to-day lives. So it's important to have all\nof these different styles and products that appeal to different people in\ndifferent settings.\n\nFinally, we're seeing people continue to spend more time with our Quest\necosystem and the community continues to grow steadily. We launched the\nMeta Quest 3S Xbox Edition last month, and we're seeing record interest in\ncloud gaming. And beyond gaming, we continue to see a broader set of use\ncases with media and web browsing contributing a significant portion of\nengagement.\n\nWe're going to have more to share on all of this, especially the Reality\nLabs work at Connect on September 17. So I encourage you all to tune into\nthat.\n\nOverall, this has been a busy quarter. Strong business performance and real\nmomentum in assembling both the talent and the compute that we need to\nbuild personal superintelligence for everyone. I am very grateful to our\nteams who are working hard to deliver all of this, and thanks to all of you\nfor being on this journey with us.\n\nAnd now here is Susan.\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our\nconsolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless\notherwise noted.\n\nQ2 total revenue was $47.5 billion, up 22% on both a reported and constant\ncurrency basis. Q2 total expenses were $27.1 billion, up 12% compared to\nlast year. In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased\n16%, driven mostly by higher infrastructure costs and payments to partners,\npartially offset by a benefit from the previously announced extension of\nsever useful lives.\n\nR&D increased 23%, mostly due to higher employee compensation and\ninfrastructure costs. Marketing and sales increased 9% primarily due to an\nincrease in professional services related to our ongoing platform integrity\nefforts as well as marketing costs, partially offset by lower employee\ncompensation. G&A decreased 27%, driven mostly by lower legal-related\ncosts.\n\nWe ended Q2 with over 75,900 employees, down 1% quarter-over-quarter, as\nthe vast majority of the employees impacted by performance-related\nreductions earlier this year were no longer captured in our head count.\nThis was partially offset by continued hiring in priority areas of\nmonetization, infrastructure, Reality Labs, AI as well as regulation and\ncompliance.\n\nSecond quarter operating income was $20.4 billion, representing a 43%\noperating margin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 11%, which reflects\nexcess tax benefits from share-based compensation due to the increase in\nour share price versus prior periods.\n\nNet income was $18.3 billion or $7.14 per share. Capital expenditures,\nincluding principal payments on finance leases were $17 billion, driven by\ninvestments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure.\n\nFree cash flow was $8.5 billion. We repurchased $9.8 billion of our Class A\ncommon stock and paid $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders. We also\nmade $15.1 billion in nonmarketable equity investments in the second\nquarter which includes our minority investment in Scale AI, along with\nother investment activities. We ended the quarter with $47.1 billion in\ncash and marketable securities and $28.8 billion in debt.\n\nMoving now to our segment results. I'll begin with our Family of Apps\nsegment. Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow, and we\nestimate more than 3.4 billion people used at least one of our Family of\nApps on a daily basis in June. Q2 total Family of Apps revenue was $47.1\nbillion, up 22% year-over-year. Q2 Family of Apps ad revenue was $46.6\nbillion, up 21% or 22% on a constant currency basis. Within that revenue,\nthe online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year\ngrowth.\n\nOn a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Europe and\nRest of World at 24% and 23%, respectively. North America and Asia Pacific\ngrew 21% and 18%.\n\nIn Q2, the total number of ad impressions served across our services\nincreased 11%, with growth mainly driven by Asia Pacific. Impression growth\naccelerated across all regions due primarily to engagement tailwinds on\nboth Facebook and Instagram and to a lesser extent, ad load optimizations\non Facebook.\n\nThe average price per ad increased 9%, benefiting from increased advertiser\ndemand, largely driven by improved ad performance. Pricing growth slowed\nmodestly from the first quarter due to the accelerated impression growth in\nQ2.\n\nFamily of Apps other revenue was $583 million, up 50%, driven by WhatsApp\npaid messaging revenue growth as well as Meta Verified subscriptions. We\ncontinue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development\nand operation of our Family of Apps.\n\nIn Q2, Family of Apps expenses were $22.2 billion, representing 82% of our\noverall expenses. Family of Apps expenses were up 14% and mainly due to\ngrowth in employee compensation and infrastructure costs, partially offset\nby lower legal-related costs.\n\nFamily of Apps operating income was $25 billion, representing a 53%\noperating margin.\n\nWithin our Reality Labs segment, Q2 revenue was $370 million up 5% year-\nover-year due to increased sales of AI glasses, partially offset by lower\nQuest sales. Reality Labs expenses were $4.9 billion, up 1% year-over-year,\ndriven by higher non-head count-related technology development costs.\nReality Labs operating loss was $4.5 billion.\n\nTurning now to the business outlook. There are two primary factors that\ndrive our revenue performance, our ability to deliver engaging experiences\nfor our community and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over\ntime.\n\nOn the first, daily actives continue to grow across Facebook, Instagram and\nWhatsApp as we make additional improvements to our recommendation systems\nand product experiences. We continue to see momentum with video engagement,\nin particular. In Q2, Instagram video time was up more than 20% year-over-\nyear globally. We're seeing strong traction on Facebook as well,\nparticularly in the U.S., where video time spent similarly expanded more\nthan 20% year-over-year. These gains have been enabled by ongoing\noptimizations to our ranking systems to better identify the most relevant\ncontent to show.\n\nWe expect to deliver additional improvements throughout the year as we\nfurther scale up our models and make recommendations more adaptive to a\nperson's interests within their session.\n\nAnother emphasis of our recommendations work is promoting original content.\nOn Instagram, over 2/3 of recommended content in the U.S. now comes from\noriginal posts. In the second half, we'll be focused on further increasing\nthe freshness of original posts, so the right audiences can discover\noriginal content from creators soon after it is posted.\n\nWe are also making good progress on our longer-term ranking innovations\nthat we expect will provide the next leg of improvements over the coming\nyears. Our research efforts to develop cross-surface foundation\nrecommendation models continue to progress. We are also seeing promising\nresults from using LLM in Threads recommendation systems. The incorporation\nof LLMs are now driving a meaningful share of the ranking related time\nspent gains on Threads.\n\nWe're now exploring how to extend the use of LLMs and recommendation\nsystems to our other apps. We're leveraging Llama and several other back-\nend processes as well, including actioning bug reports so we can identify\nand resolve recurring issues more quickly and efficiently. This has\nresulted in top line bug reports in the U.S. and Canada in Facebook Feed\nand notifications dropping by roughly 30% over the past 10 months.\n\nThe primary way we're using Llama in our apps today is to power Meta AI\nwhich is now available in over 200 countries and territories. WhatsApp\ncontinues to be the largest driver of queries as people message Meta AI\ndirectly for tasks such as information gathering, homework assistance and\ngenerating images. Outside of WhatsApp, we're seeing Meta AI become an\nincreasingly valuable complement to our content discovery engines. Meta AI\nusage on Facebook is expanding as people use it to ask about posts they see\nin Feed and find content across our platform in Search.\n\nAnother way we expect Meta AI will help with content discovery is through\nthe automatic translation and dubbing of foreign language content into the\naudience's local language. We'll have more to share on our efforts there\nlater this year.\n\nMoving to Reality Labs. The growth of Ray-Ban Meta sales accelerated in Q2,\nwith demand still outstripping supply for the most popular SKUs despite\nincreases to our production earlier this year. We're working to ramp supply\nto better meet consumer demand later this year.\n\nNow to the second driver of our revenue performance, increasing\nmonetization efficiency. The first part of this work is optimizing the\nlevel of ads within organic engagement. We continue to optimize ad supply\nacross each surface to better deliver ads at the time and place they are\nmost relevant to people. In Q2, we also began introducing ads within Feed\non Threads and the Updates tab of WhatsApp, which is a separate space away\nfrom people's chats.\n\nAs of May, advertisers globally can now run video and image ads to Threads\nusers in most countries, including the United States. While ad supply\nremains low and Threads is not expected to be a meaningful contributor to\noverall impression growth in the near term, we are optimistic about the\nlonger-term opportunity with Threads as the community and engagement grow\nand monetization scales.\n\nOn WhatsApp, we are rolling out ads in status and channels, along with\nchannel subscriptions in the Updates tab to help businesses reach the more\nthan 1.5 billion daily actives who visit that part of the app. We expect\nthe introduction of ads and status will be gradual over the course of this\nyear and next, with low levels of expected ad supply initially.\n\nWe also expect WhatsApp ads and status to earn a lower average price than\nFacebook or Instagram ads for the foreseeable future, due in part towards\nWhatsApp skew toward lower monetizing markets, and more limited information\nthat can be used for targeting. Given this, we do not expect ads and status\nto be a meaningful contributor to total impressions or revenue growth for\nthe next few years.\n\nThe second part of increasing monetization efficiency is improving\nmarketing performance. There are three areas of this work that I'll focus\non today, improving our ad systems, advancing our ads products, including\nby building tools that assist in ads creation and evolving our ads platform\nto drive results that are optimized for each business' objectives.\n\nFirst is our ad systems where we're innovating in both the ads retrieval\nand ranking stages to serve more relevant ads to people. A lot of this work\ninvolves us continuing to advance the modeling innovations we've introduced\npreviously while expanding their adoption across our platform.\n\nThe Andromeda model architecture we began introducing in the second half of\n2024 powers the ads retrieval stage of our ad system, where we select the\nfew thousand most relevant ads from tens of millions of potential\ncandidates. In Q2, we made enhancements to Andromeda that enabled it to\nselect more relevant and more personalized ads candidates while also\nexpanding coverage to Facebook Reels. These improvements have driven nearly\n4% higher conversions on Facebook Mobile Feed and Reels.\n\nOur new Generative Ads Recommendation system, or GEM, powers the ranking\nstage of our ad system, which is the part of the process after ads\nretrieval where we determine which ads to show someone from candidates\nsuggested by our retrieval engine. In Q2, we improved the performance of\nGEM by further scaling our training capacity and adding organic and ads\nengagement data on Instagram. We also incorporated new advanced sequence\nmodeling techniques that helped us double the length of event sequences we\nuse, enabling our systems to consider a longer history of the content or\nads that a person has engaged with in order to provide better ad\nselections.\n\nThe combination of these improvements increased ad conversions by\napproximately 5% on Instagram and 3% on Facebook Feed and Reels in Q2.\n\nFinally, we expanded coverage of our Lattice model architecture in Q2. We\nfirst began deploying Lattice in 2023 with our later-stage ads ranking\nefforts, allowing us to run significantly larger models that generalize\nlearnings across objectives and surfaces in place of numerous smaller ads\nmodels that have historically been optimized for individual objectives and\nsurfaces.\n\nIn April, we began deploying Lattice to earlier-stage ads ranking models as\nwell. This is leading not only to greater capacity and engineering\nefficiency but also improved performance with the recent Lattice\ndeployments driving a nearly 4% increase in ad conversions across Facebook\nFeed and Reels in Q2.\n\nNext, ad products. Here, we're seeing strong momentum with our Advantage+\nsuite of AI-powered solutions. In Q2, we completed the rollout of our\nstreamlined campaign creation flow for Advantage+ sales and app campaigns,\nwhich makes it easier for advertisers to realize the performance benefits\nfrom Advantage+ by having it turned on at the beginning. We've seen lifts\nin advertiser adoption of sales and app campaigns since we've expanded\navailability and are working to complete the rollout for leads campaigns in\nthe coming months.\n\nWithin our Advantage+ Creative suite, adoption of genAI ad creative tools\ncontinues to broaden. Nearly 2 million advertisers are now using our video\ngeneration features, image animation and video expansion, and we're seeing\nstrong results with our text generation tools as we continue to add new\nfeatures.\n\nIn Q2, we started testing AI-powered translation so that advertisers can\nautomatically translate the caption of their ads to 10 different languages.\nWhile it's early, we have seen promising performance lifts in our prelaunch\ntests.\n\nWe're also continuing to see strong adoption of image expansion among small-\n and medium-sized advertisers, which speaks to how these tools help\nbusinesses who have fewer resources to develop creative. With larger\nadvertisers, we expect agencies will continue to be valuable partners in\nhelping apply these new tools to drive performance.\n\nOutside of Advantage+, we're seeing good momentum in business messaging,\nparticularly in the U.S., where click to message revenue grew more than 40%\nyear-over-year in Q2. The strong U.S. growth is benefiting from a ramp in\nadoption of our website to message ads, which drive people to a business's\nwebsite for more information before choosing to launch a chat with the\nbusiness in one of our messaging apps.\n\nFinally, we continue to evolve our ads platform to drive results that are\noptimized for each business' objectives and the way they measure results.\nIn Q2, we completed the global rollout of our incremental attribution\nfeature, which is the only product on the market that optimizes for and\nreports on incremental conversions, which are conversions that would not\nhave happened without a person seeing the ad.\n\nWe also launched omnichannel ads globally in Q2 and which enable\nadvertisers to optimize for incremental sales, both in-store and online\nwith just one campaign. In tests, advertisers using omnichannel ads have\nseen a median 15% reduction in total cost per purchase compared to website-\nonly optimization.\n\nNext, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. Our\nprimary focus remains investing capital back into the business with\ninfrastructure and talent being our top priorities.\n\nI'll start with hiring. Our approach to adding head count continues to be\ntargeted at the company's highest priority areas. We expect talent\nadditions across all of our priority areas will continue to drive overall\nhead count growth through this year and 2026. While head count growth in\nour other functions remains constrained, within AI, we've had a particular\nemphasis on recruiting leading talent within the industry, as we build out\nMeta Superintelligence Labs to accelerate our AI model development and\nproduct initiatives.\n\nNext, infrastructure. We expect having sufficient compute capacity will be\ncentral to realizing many of the largest opportunities in front of us over\nthe coming years. We continue to see very compelling returns from our AI\ncapacity investments in our core ads and organic engagement initiatives and\nexpect to continue investing significantly there in 2026.\n\nWe also expect that developing leading AI infrastructure will be a core\nadvantage in developing the best AI models and product experiences. So we\nexpect to ramp our investments significantly in 2026 to support that work.\n\nMoving to our financial outlook. We expect third quarter 2025 total revenue\nto be in the range of $47.5 billion to $50.5 billion. Our guidance assumes\nforeign currency is an approximately 1% tailwind to year-over-year total\nrevenue growth, based on current exchange rates. While we are not providing\nan outlook for fourth quarter revenue, we would expect our year-over-year\ngrowth rate in the fourth quarter of 2025 to be slower than the third\nquarter as we lap a period of stronger growth in the fourth quarter of\n2024.\n\nTurning now to the expense outlook. We expect full year 2025 total expenses\nto be in the range of $114 billion to $118 billion, narrowed from our prior\noutlook of $113 billion to $118 billion and reflecting a growth rate of 20%\nto 24% year-over-year.\n\nWhile we're still very early in planning for next year, there are a few\nfactors we expect will provide meaningful upward pressure on our 2026 total\nexpense growth rate. The largest single driver of growth will be\ninfrastructure costs, driven by a sharp acceleration in depreciation\nexpense growth and higher operating costs as we continue to scale up our\ninfrastructure fleet. Aside from infrastructure, we expect the second\nlargest driver of growth to be employee compensation as we add technical\ntalent in priority areas and recognize a full year of compensation expenses\nfor employees hired throughout 2025. We expect these factors will result in\na 2026 year-over-year expense growth rate that is above the 2025 expense\ngrowth rate.\n\nTurning now to the CapEx outlook. We currently expect 2025 capital\nexpenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to be in the\nrange of $66 billion to $72 billion, narrowed from our prior outlook of $64\nbillion to $72 billion and up approximately $30 billion year-over-year at\nthe midpoint. While the infrastructure planning process remains highly\ndynamic, we currently expect another year of similarly significant CapEx\ndollar growth in 2026 as we continue aggressively pursuing opportunities to\nbring additional capacity online to meet the needs of our AI efforts and\nbusiness operations.\n\nOn to tax. With the enactment of the new U.S. tax law, we anticipate a\nreduction in our U.S. federal cash tax for the remainder of the current\nyear and future years. There are several alternative ways of implementing\nthe provisions of the act, which we are currently evaluating. While we\nestimate that the 2025 tax rate will be higher than our Q2 tax rate, we\ncannot quantify the magnitude at this time.\n\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape,\nincluding the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU that\ncould significantly impact our business and our financial results. For\nexample, we continue to engage with the European Commission on our Less\nPersonalized Ads offering or LPA, which we introduced in November 2024 and\nbased on feedback from the European Commission in connection with the DMA.\n\nAs the commission provides further feedback on LPA, we cannot rule out that\nit may seek to impose further modifications to it that would result in a\nmaterially worse user and advertiser experience. This could have a\nsignificant negative impact on our European revenue as early as later this\nquarter. We have appealed the European Commission's DMA decision, but any\nmodifications to our model may be imposed during the appeal process.\n\nIn closing, this was another strong quarter for our business as our\ninvestments in infrastructure and technical talent continue to improve core\nads performance and engagement on our platforms. We expect the significant\ninvestments we're making now will allow us to continue leveraging advances\nin AI to extend those gains and unlock a new set of opportunities in the\nyears to come.\nWith that, Krista, let's open up the call for questions.",
  "qa_text": "Operator\n\n[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Eric\nSheridan with Goldman Sachs.\n\nEric James Sheridan\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\n\nMark, when you think about where the AI parts of your business have been\nevolving over the last 3 to 6 months, I wanted to know what your key\nlearnings were as you went deep into that strategy that informed some of\nthe shifts in both talent, acquisition and compute, coupled with some of\nthe blogs you put out recently in terms of how that strategy might have\nevolved based on those key learnings?\n\nAnd Susan, building on Mark's comments on scaling talent and compute, I\nwant to know if you go a little bit deeper on how we should be thinking\nabout those two components driving some of the commentary you've given\naround OpEx and CapEx over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nYes, sure. I can start. At a high level, I think that there are all these\nquestions that people have about what are going to be the time lines to get\nto really strong AI or superintelligence or whatever you want to call it.\nAnd I guess that each step along the way so far, we've observed the more\nkind of aggressive assumptions, or the fastest assumptions have been the\nones that have most accurately predicted what would happen. And I think\nthat, that just continued to happen over the course of this year, too.\n\nAnd so I've given a number of those anecdotes on these earnings calls in\nthe past. And I think, certainly, some of the work that we're seeing with\nteams internally being able to adapt Llama 4 to build autonomous AI agents\nthat can help improve the Facebook algorithm to increase quality and\nengagement are like -- I mean, that's like a fairly profound thing if you\nthink about it. I mean it's happening in low volume right now. So I'm not\nsure that, that result by itself was a major contributor to this quarter's\nearnings or anything like that. But I think the trajectory on this stuff is\nvery optimistic.\n\nAnd I think it's one of the interesting challenges in running a business\nlike this now is there's just a very high chance it seems like the world is\ngoing to look pretty different in a few years from now. And on the one\nhand, there are all these things that we can do, there are improvements to\nour core products that exist.\n\nAnd then I think we have this principle that we believe in across the\ncompany, which we tell people take superintelligence seriously. And the\nbasic principle is this idea that we think that this is going to really\nshape all of our systems sooner rather than later, not necessarily on the\ntrajectory of a quarter or 2, but on the trajectory of a few years. And I\nthink that that's just going to change a lot of the assumptions around how\ndifferent things work across the company.\n\nSo anyway, I think it's basically just what we're continually observing how\nthis works and what the trajectory or the pace of AI progress has been. I\nthink it continues to be on the faster end. And that I think informs a lot\nof the decisions from everything from the importance and value of having\nthe absolute best and most elite talent-dense team at the company to making\nsure that we have a leading compute fleet so that the people here can do --\nobviously, the researchers here have more compute per person to be able to\nlead their research and then roll it out to billions of people across our\nproducts, making sure that we build and drive these products through all of\nthe different things that we do, which I think is one of the things that\nour company is the best in the world at is basically when we take a\ntechnology, we're good at driving that through all of our apps and our ad\nsystems and all that stuff, it's not just going to kind of sit on the vine.\n\nI think that there's no other company, I think that is as good as us at\nkind of taking something and kind of getting it in front of billions of\npeople. So yes, I mean, we're just going to push very aggressively on all\nof that. But at some level, yes, this is -- there's sort of a bet in the\ntrajectory that we're seeing and those are the signals that we're seeing.\nBut we're just trying to read it.\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nEric, for the second part of your question, we haven't, in fact, kicked off\nour budgeting process for 2026. So thinking about next year, there are\nclearly many, many moving pieces in a very dynamic operating environment.\nBut there are certain aspects that we have some visibility into today,\nincluding the rough shape of our 2026 infrastructure plans. And that flows\nthrough into our expense expectations next year. And we also have some\nvisibility into the compensation expense growth that we'll recognize from\nthe AI talent that we're hiring this year. And so those two things are part\nof why we gave a little bit of an early preview into the expectations for\ngrowth for 2026 total expenses as well as for 2026 CapEx.\n\nSo on the total expenses side, as I mentioned, we expect infrastructure\nwill be the single largest contributor to 2026 expense growth. That's\ndriven primarily by a sharp acceleration in depreciation expense growth in\n2026, largely driven by recognizing incremental depreciation from assets\nthat we purchased and place in service in '26 as well as from\ninfrastructure deployed through 2025 that will recognize a full year of\ndepreciation next year. We also expect a greater mix of our CapEx to be in\nshorter-lived assets in 2025 and '26 than it has been in prior years.\n\nAnd then the other component of infra cost growth next year would come from\nhigher operating expenses, including energy costs, leases, maintenance and\noperational expenses that are associated with maintaining that fleet. And\nwe also expect some increased spend on cloud services in '26 to meet our\ncapacity needs as well as growth in network-related costs.\n\nSo a lot going on, on the infrastructure side as it contributes to the 2026\ntotal expense number. After that, employee compensation is the next largest\ndriver of expense growth in '26. Again, driven primarily in the investments\nthat we're making in technical talent, including recognizing a full year of\ncompensation expense for the AI talent we hire this year.\n\nI realize this answer is getting a little long, so I'll try to wrap up\nquickly. On the CapEx side, the big driver of our increased CapEx in '26\nwill be scaling genAI capacity as we build out training capacity that's\ngoing to drive higher spend across servers, networking, data centers next\nyear. We also expect that we're going to continue investing significantly\nin core AI in 2026. And again, this is a pretty -- a very dynamic area of\nplanning, but we wanted to share kind of our early thoughts as things are\nshaping up.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\n\nBrian Thomas Nowak\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\n\nI have two. The first one, Mark, just to kind of go back to the\nintelligence labs and sort of the vision for superintelligence. As you sort\nof sit here now versus 12 months ago, can you just sort of walk us through\nany changes of technological constraints or technological gating factors\nthat you are most focused on overcoming in the next 24 months that may have\nbeen different than they were in the past, just to make sure you can really\nlead in the idea of superintelligence over the next 10 years?\n\nAnd then the second one to Susan or Mark, one on the core. You've made so\nmany improvements to the core to drive higher engagement, recommendations,\net cetera. Can you just walk us through a couple of the factors you're\nstill most excited about to come in the next 18 months that you think could\ndrive a further lift to engagement on the core platform?\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nYes, sure. I mean in terms of the research agenda and a bunch of the areas\nthat we're very focused on, I do think focusing on self-improvement is a\nvery important area of research. And there's obviously different scaling\nparadigms, and I don't want to get too much into the detail of research\nthat we're doing on this. But I think that for developing\nsuperintelligence, at some level, you're not just going to be learning from\npeople because you're trying to build something that is fundamentally\nsmarter than people. So it's going to need to learn how to -- or you're\ngoing to need to develop a way for it to be able to improve itself.\n\nSo that, I think, is a very fundamental thing. That is going to have a very\nbroad implications for how we build products, how we run the company, new\nthings that we can invent, new discoveries that can be made, society more\nbroadly. I think that that's just a very fundamental part of this.\n\nIn terms of the shape of the effort overall, I guess I've just gotten a\nlittle bit more convinced around the ability for small talent-dense teams\nto be the optimal configuration for driving frontier research. And it's a\nbit of a different setup than we have on our other world-class machine\nlearning system.\n\nSo if you look at like what we do in Instagram or Facebook or our ad\nsystem, we can very productively have many hundreds or thousands of people\nbasically working on improving those systems, and we have very well-\ndeveloped systems for kind of individuals to run tests and be able to test\na bunch of different things. You don't need every researcher there to have\nthe whole system in their head. But I think for this -- for the leading\nresearch on superintelligence, you really want the smallest group that can\nhold the whole thing in their head, which drives, I think, some of the\nphysics around the team size and how -- and the dynamics around how that\nworks.\n\nBut I'll hand it over to Susan to talk about more of the practical stuff.\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nBrian, on the sort of forward-looking road map for the core recommendation\nengine. There are a handful of shorter-term things that we're focused on in\nthe near term. One is we're focused on making recommendations even more\nadaptive to what a person is engaging with during their session so that the\nrecommendations we surface are the most relevant to what they're interested\nin at that moment. And we're making optimizations to help the best content\nfrom smaller creators break-out by matching it to the right audiences\nsooner after it gets posted.\n\nAnd we're also working on improving the ability for our systems to discover\nmore diversified and niche interest for each person through interest\nexploration and learning explicit user preferences. We're also planning to\nscale up our models further and incorporate more advanced techniques that\nshould improve the overall quality of recommendations.\n\nBut we also have a lot of long-term bets in the hopper around areas like\ndeveloping foundational models that will support recommendations across\nmultiple services. Incorporating LLMs more deeply into our recommendation\nsystems. And a big focus of this work is going to be on optimizing the\nsystems to make them more efficient. So that we can continue to scale up\nthe capacity that we use for our recommendation systems without eroding the\nROI that we deliver.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\n\nDouglas Till Anmuth\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nOne for Mark and one for Susan. Mark, Meta has been a huge proponent of\nopen source AI, has your thinking changed here at all, just as you pursue\nsuperintelligence and push for even greater returns on your significant\ninfrastructure investments?\n\nAnd then, Susan, your comments on '26 CapEx suggest more than $100 billion\nof spend next year potentially. Do you continue to expect to finance all\nthis yourself? Or could there be opportunities to partner here?\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nYes. I mean on open source, I don't think that our thinking has\nparticularly changed on this. We've always open sourced some of our models\nand not open sourced everything that we've done. So I would expect that we\nwill continue to produce and share leading open source models.\n\nI also think that there are a couple of trends that are playing out. One is\nthat we're getting models that are so big that they're just not practical\nfor a lot of other people to use. So it's -- we would kind of wrestle with\nwhether it's productive or helpful to share that or if that's really just\nprimarily helping competitors or something like that. So I think that\nthere's that concern. And then obviously, as you approach real\nsuperintelligence, I think there is a whole different set of safety\nconcerns that I think we need to take very seriously, that I wrote about in\nmy note this morning.\n\nBut I think the bottom line is, I would expect that we will continue open\nsourcing work. I expect us to continue to be a leader there. And I also\nexpect us to continue to not open source everything that we do, which is a\ncontinuation of kind of what we've been kind of working on.\n\nAnd yes, I mean, I think Susan will talk a little bit more about the\ninfrastructure, but it really is a massive investment. We think it will be\ngood over time. But we do take very seriously that this is a just massive\namount of capital to convert into many gigawatts of compute which we think\nis going to help us produce leading research and quality products and in\nrunning the business, I do look for opportunities to basically convert\ncapital into quality of products that we can deliver for people. But this\nis certainly a massive bet that we're kind of -- we're focused on, and we\nwant to make sure that what we build accrues to building the best products\nthat we can deliver to the billions of people who use our services.\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nDoug, on your second question about how we expect to finance the growing\nCapEx next year. We certainly expect that we will finance some large share\nof that ourselves, but we're also exploring ways to work with financial\npartners to co-develop data centers. We don't have any finalized\ntransactions to announce, but we generally believe that there will be\nmodels here that will attract significant external financing to support\nlarge-scale data center projects that are developed using our ability to\nbuild world-class infrastructure while providing us with flexibility should\nour infrastructure requirements change over time. So we are exploring many\ndifferent paths.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.\n\nJustin Post\nBofA Securities, Research Division\n\nI'll ask another one on infrastructure. Mark, your spend is now approaching\nsome of the biggest hyperscalers out there. Do you think of all this\ncapacity mostly for internal uses? Or do you think there's a way to share\nor even come up with a business model where leveraging that capacity for\nexternal uses?\n\nAnd then Susan, when you think about the ROI on this CapEx, I'm sure you\nhave internal models, I'm sure you can't share all that, but how are you\nthinking about the ROI? And are you optimistic about the long-term returns?\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nJustin, I can go ahead and take a crack at both of those. And obviously,\nMark, you should feel free to weigh in.\n\nRight now, we are focused on ensuring that we have enough capacity for our\ninternal use cases, which includes both all of the core AI work that we do\nto support the recommendation engine work on the organic content side to\nsupport all the ads ranking and recommendation work. And then, of course,\nto make sure that we are building the training capacity that we think we\nneed in order to build frontier AI models. And to make sure that we're\npreparing ourselves for the types of inference use cases that we think\nmight -- that we might have ahead of us as we eventually focus not only on\ndeveloping frontier models, but also how we can expand into the kinds of\nconsumer use cases that we think will be hopefully widely useful and\nengaging for our users.\n\nSo at present, we're not really thinking about external use cases on the\ninfrastructure, but it's a good question.\n\nOn your second question, which is really around the sort of ROI on CapEx,\nthere are a couple of things. So again, on the core AI side, we continue to\nsee strong ROI. Our ability to measure that is quite good, and we feel sort\nof very good about the rigorous measurement and returns that we see there.\n\nOn the genAI side, we are clearly much, much earlier on the return curve\nand we don't expect that the genAI work is going to be a meaningful driver\nof revenue this year or next year. But we remain generally very optimistic\nabout the monetization opportunities that will open up, and Mark spoke to\nthem in his script, the sort of five pillars, so I won't repeat them here.\nAnd we think that over the medium- to long-term time frame, those are\nopportunities that are very adjacent and intuitive for where -- in terms of\nwhere our business is today, why they would be big opportunities for us and\nthat there will be sort of big markets attached to each of them.\n\nSo we, again, are also, I would say -- the last thing I would add here is\nwe are building the infrastructure with fungibility in mind. Obviously,\nthere are a lot of things that you have to build up front in terms of the\ndata center shells, the networking infrastructure, et cetera. But we will\nbe ordering servers, which ultimately will be the biggest bulk of CapEx\nspend as we need them and when we need them and making sort of the best\ndecisions at those times in terms of figuring out where the capacity will\ngo to use.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Shmulik with Bernstein.\n\nMark Elliott Shmulik\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\n\nMark, as you go after the superintelligence vision, especially for those of\nus on the outside, what are kind of some of the markers or KPIs that you're\ntracking on whether you're on track and making progress? Is it really\nagainst kind of those five pillars you outlined above? Or should we be\nthinking more broadly?\n\nAnd Susan, obviously AI delivering great ROI today, all those investments\nand also building towards kind of longer-term goals, just curious, has\nthere just been any change or adjustment to how you think about the\nrelationship between revenues or core business performance and the cadence\nof investment?\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nYes, in terms of what to look at, I mean, what I'm going to look at\ninternally, the quality of the people on the teams, the quality of the\nmodels that we're producing, the rate of improvement of our other AI\nsystems across the company and the extent to which the leading kind of\nfoundation models that we're building contribute to improving all of the\nother AI systems and kind of everything that we're doing around the\ncompany.\n\nThen I think you just get into our standard product and business playbook,\nwhich is translating that technology into new products, which will first\nscale to billions of people and then over time, we will monetize. But I\nthink that there's going to be some lag in that, right? And that, I think,\nis kind of always the way that we work is, whether we're building some new\nsocial product or this, something like Meta AI or a new product around\nthis, we're going to work on getting to leading scale, building the highest\nquality product, focused on that for a few years. And then once we're\nreally confident in that position, then we'll focus on ramping up the\nbusiness around it.\n\nSo it's -- I mean, going back to the last question a little bit, it's sort\nof when you compare this business to some of the cloud businesses, it's\nlike we do have this delay where we focus on building research and then\ndoing research and then ramping consumer products, and it often does take\nsome period of time before we really are ramping up the business around it.\nI think that's kind of a known property of our business and the cycle\naround it.\n\nBut I guess, on the flip side, we believe that if you are building\nsuperintelligence, you should use all of your GPUs to make it so that\nyou're serving your customers really well with that. And we think that\nthere's going to be a much higher return than we can do by generating that\ndirectly rather than just kind of renting or leasing out the infrastructure\nat other companies.\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nOn the second part of your question, we've said in the past that our\nprimary focus from a profitability perspective is driving consolidated\noperating profit growth over time. And it won't be linear. In some years,\nwe'll deliver above-average profit growth. And in years where we're making\nbig investments, I think we will see that impact the amount of operating\nprofit growth that we can deliver.\n\nAnd at the moment, we see a lot of attractive investment opportunities that\nwe believe are going to set us up to deliver compelling profit growth in\nthe coming years for all of our investors. And so we're focused on\nconstraining investments elsewhere as we pursue those investments. But we\nreally believe that this is a time for us to really make investments in the\nfuture of AI as I think it will open up both new opportunities for us in\naddition to strengthen our core business.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citi.\n\nRonald Victor Josey\nCitigroup Inc., Research Division\n\nMark, I wanted to ask you on Meta AI, and I think you talked about in the\ncall just growing engagement overall, particularly on WhatsApp. And now we\nhave 1 billion users on the platform and the focus is now on driving\npersonalization. So I want to understand a little bit more how these next-\ngen models can help drive adoption here, particularly with Behemoth coming\nonline at some point.\n\nAnd then as people are using that Meta AI with WhatsApp, thoughts on search\nand queries and potentially monetizing that.\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nYes, I'm not going to get super deep into the road map on this, but the\nbasic -- we do see that as we continue improving the models behind Meta AI\nand post training and just engagement increases and as we swap in the\nupdated models, when we go from Llama 4 to Llama 4.1 when we have that, we\nexpect that just -- the models are inherently pretty general. So it's --\nyes, you focus on specific areas, but in general, it just sort of gets\nbetter at a lot of different things that people want to ask it or want to\ndo with it. And I think with each version, both like what we're doing on a\nweek-to-week basis in terms of continuing to train it, and when we drop\nkind of new generations or big dot releases of each generation, that will\nimprove engagement, too.\n\nSo we're focused on that. I'm not going to go into the specific research\nareas or capabilities that we're planning on dropping in the future. But\nobviously, I'm pretty excited about it.\n\nOperator\n\nThe last question comes from the line of use of Youssef Squali with Truist\nSecurities.\n\nYoussef Houssaini Squali\nTruist Securities, Inc., Research Division\n\nI have two. So Mark, the Ray-Ban initiative has been a [ hallmark ] for you\nguys so far. Where are we on the development of glasses? And has that new\ncomputational platform that you've talked about in the past, is it moving\nfaster or slower than you thought? And as you leverage Meta AI, do you\nbelieve glasses ultimately replace smartphones? Or do you need the new form\nfactor that's AI first?\n\nAnd then, Susan, just quickly, how do you guys see SBC progressing over the\nnext couple of years? Is it fair to assume it will grow materially faster\nthan the revenue and OpEx? And how do you minimize shareholder dilution?\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nYes, I can talk a bit about the glasses. Yes, I mean, I'm very excited\nabout the progress that we're making. I think both the Ray-Ban Metas and\nI'm very excited about the Oakley Meta, the HSTNs too. And other things\nthat we have planned. Yes, I mean, this product category is clearly doing\nquite well. And I think it's good for a lot of things. It is stylish\neyewear, so people like wearing them just as glasses. It has a bunch of\ninteresting functionality. And then the use of Meta AI in them just\ncontinues to grow, and the percent of people who are using it for that on a\ndaily basis is increasing, and that's all good to see.\n\nI mean, I continue to think that glasses are basically going to be the\nideal form factor for AI because you can let an AI see what you see\nthroughout the day, hear what you hear, talk to you. Once you get a display\nin there, whether it's the kind of wide holographic field of view like we\nshowed with Orion or just a smaller display that might be good for\ndisplaying some information, and that's also going to unlock a lot of value\nwhere you can just interact with an AI system throughout the day in this\nmultimodal way. It can see the content around you, it can generate a UI for\nyou, show you information and be helpful.\n\nI mean, I personally think that just like if -- I wear contact lenses, I\nfeel like if I didn't have my vision corrected, I'd be sort of at a\ncognitive disadvantage going through the world. And I think in the future,\nif you don't have glasses that have AI or some way to interact with AI, I\nthink you're kind of similarly, probably be at a pretty significant\ncognitive disadvantage compared to other people and who you're working\nwith, or competing against.\n\nSo I think that this is a pretty fundamental form factor. There are a lot\nof different versions of it. Right now, we're building ones that I think\nare stylish, but aren't focused on the display. I think there's a whole set\nof different things to explore with displays. This is kind of what we've\nbeen maxing out with Reality Labs over the last 5 to 10 years is basically\ndoing the research on all of these different things.\n\nAnd it's a -- I don't know, 10 years ago, I would have -- like the other\nthing that's awesome about glasses is, they are going to be the ideal way\nto blend the physical and digital worlds together. So the whole metaverse\nvision, I think, is going to end up being extremely important, too, and AI\nis going to accelerate that, too.\n\nIt -- just that if you'd asked me 5 years ago, whether we'd have kind of\nholograms that created immersive experiences or superintelligence first, I\nthink most people would have thought that you'd get the holograms first.\nAnd it's this interesting kind of quirk of the tech industry that I think\nwe're going to end up having really strong AI first. But because we've been\ninvesting in this, I think we're just several years ahead on building out\nglasses. And I think that that's something that we're excited to keep on\ninvesting in heavily because I think it's going to be a really important\npart of the future.\n\nKenneth J. Dorell\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nYoussef, we didn't quite get your second question, do you mind just\nrepeating it?\n\nYoussef Houssaini Squali\nTruist Securities, Inc., Research Division\n\nSure. Just as you look at the spend on stock-based compensation over the\nnext couple of years with all these hires, I'm assuming that we're going to\nsee that materially -- or grow materially faster maybe than revenue and\nOpEx. And I just want to know how -- what you guys are doing to plan to\nminimize shareholder dilution. Is it mostly buybacks or anything else?\n\nSusan J. S. Li\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Youssef. So I mean, the impact of the sort of increased\ncompensation costs, including SBC, of our AI hires this year is reflected\nin the revised 2025 expense outlook and in the -- the comments I made about\nsort of 2026 expense outlook. Those are obviously a big driver of 2026\nexpense growth as we recognize the full year of compensation for the\nadditional talent we're bringing on.\n\nHaving said that, so we factored that into our sort of expense outlook.\nHaving said that, we certainly -- we are very focused on making sure on\nkeeping an eye on dilution. And we generally believe that our strong\nfinancial position is going to allow us to support these investments while\ncontinuing to repurchase shares as part of the sort of buyback program that\noffsets equity compensation and as well as provide quarterly cash dividend\ndistributions to our investors.\n\nKenneth J. Dorell\nDirector of Investor RelationsGreat. Thank you, everyone, for joining us\ntoday.

      "text": "Founder, Chairman & CEO All right. Thanks, Ken. Thanks, everyone, for joining today. We had another strong quarter with more than 3.4 billion people using at least one of our apps each day and strong engagement across the board. Our business continues to perform very well, which enables us to invest heavily in our AI efforts. Over the last few months, we've begun to see glimpses of our AI systems improving themselves. And the improvement is slow for now, but undeniable and developing superintelligence, which we define as AI that surpasses human intelligence in every way, we think, is now in sight. Meta's vision is to bring personal superintelligence to everyone, so that people can direct it towards what they value in their own lives. And we believe that this has the potential to begin an exciting new era of individual empowerment. A lot has been written about all the economic and scientific advances that superintelligence can bring, and I'm extremely optimistic about this. But I think that if history is a guide, then an even more important role will be how superintelligence empowers people to be more creative, develop culture and communities, connect with each other and lead more fulfilling lives. To build this future, we've established Meta Superintelligence Labs, which includes our foundations, product and FAIR teams as well as a new lab that is focused on developing the next generation of our models. We're making good progress towards Llama 4.1 and 4.2, and in parallel, we are also working on our next generation of models that will push the frontier in the next year or so. We are building an elite, talent-dense team Alexandr Wang is leading the overall team, Nat Friedman is leading our AI Products and Applied Research, and Shengjia Zhao is Chief Scientist for the new effort. They are all incredibly talented leaders, and I'm excited to work closely with them and the world-class group of AI researchers and infrastructure and data engineers that we're assembling. I've spent a lot of time building this team this quarter. And the reason that so many people are excited to join is because Meta has all of the ingredients that are required to build leading models and deliver them to billions of people. The people who are joining us are going to have access to unparalleled compute as we build out several multi-gigawatt clusters. Our Prometheus cluster is coming online next year, and we think it's going to be the world's first gigawatt-plus cluster. We're also building out Hyperion, which will be able to scale up to 5 gigawatts over several years, and we have multiple more titan clusters in development as well. We are making all these investments because we have conviction that superintelligence is going to improve every aspect of what we do. From a business perspective, I mentioned last quarter that there are five basic opportunities that we are pursuing, improved advertising, more engaging experiences, business messaging, Meta AI and AI devices. So I can go into a bit of detail on each. On advertising, the strong performance this quarter is largely thanks to AI unlocking greater efficiency and gains across our ad system. This quarter, we expanded our new AI-powered recommendation model for ads to new surfaces and improved its performance by using more signals and longer context. It's driven roughly 5% more ad conversions on Instagram and 3% on Facebook. We're also seeing good progress with AI for ad creative with a meaningful percent of our ad revenue now coming from campaigns using one of our generative AI features. This is going to be especially valuable for smaller advertisers with limited budgets. While agencies will continue the important work to help larger brands apply these tools strategically. The second opportunity is more engaging experiences. AI is significantly improving our ability to show people content that they're going to find interesting and useful. Advancements in our recommendation systems have improved quality so much that it has led to a 5% increase in time spent on Facebook and 6% on Instagram, just this quarter. There is a lot of potential for content itself to get better too, we're seeing early progress with the launch of our AI video editing tools across Meta AI and our new Edits app. And there's a lot more to do here. The third opportunity is business messaging. I've talked before about how I believe every business will soon have a business AI, just like they have an e-mail address, social media account and website. We are starting to see some product market fit in a number of countries where we're testing these agents, and we're integrating these business AIs into ads on Facebook and Instagram as well as directly into e-commerce websites. The fourth opportunity is Meta AI. Its reach is already quite impressive with more than 1 billion monthly actives. Our focus is now deepening the experience and making Meta AI the leading personal AI. As we continue improving our models, we see engagement grow. So our next generation of models is going to continue to really help here. And the fifth opportunity is AI devices. We continue to see strong momentum with our Ray-Ban Meta glasses with sales accelerating. We are also launching new performance AI glasses with the Oakley Meta HSTN, they have longer battery life, higher resolution camera and are designed for sports. The percent of people using Meta AI is growing, and we are seeing new users AI retention increase too, which is a good sign for that continued use. I think that AI glasses are going to be the main way that we integrate superintelligence into our day-to-day lives. So it's important to have all of these different styles and products that appeal to different people in different settings. Finally, we're seeing people continue to spend more time with our Quest ecosystem and the community continues to grow steadily. We launched the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition last month, and we're seeing record interest in cloud gaming. And beyond gaming, we continue to see a broader set of use cases with media and web browsing contributing a significant portion of engagement. We're going to have more to share on all of this, especially the Reality Labs work at Connect on September 17. So I encourage you all to tune into that. Overall, this has been a busy quarter. Strong business performance and real momentum in assembling both the talent and the compute that we need to build personal superintelligence for everyone. I am very grateful to our teams who are working hard to deliver all of this, and thanks to all of you for being on this journey with us. And now here is Susan.",

      "text": "Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q2 total revenue was $47.5 billion, up 22% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Q2 total expenses were $27.1 billion, up 12% compared to last year. In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased 16%, driven mostly by higher infrastructure costs and payments to partners, partially offset by a benefit from the previously announced extension of sever useful lives. R&D increased 23%, mostly due to higher employee compensation and infrastructure costs. Marketing and sales increased 9% primarily due to an increase in professional services related to our ongoing platform integrity efforts as well as marketing costs, partially offset by lower employee compensation. G&A decreased 27%, driven mostly by lower legal-related costs. We ended Q2 with over 75,900 employees, down 1% quarter-over-quarter, as the vast majority of the employees impacted by performance-related reductions earlier this year were no longer captured in our head count. This was partially offset by continued hiring in priority areas of monetization, infrastructure, Reality Labs, AI as well as regulation and compliance. Second quarter operating income was $20.4 billion, representing a 43% operating margin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 11%, which reflects excess tax benefits from share-based compensation due to the increase in our share price versus prior periods. Net income was $18.3 billion or $7.14 per share. Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases were $17 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure. Free cash flow was $8.5 billion. We repurchased $9.8 billion of our Class A common stock and paid $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders. We also made $15.1 billion in nonmarketable equity investments in the second quarter which includes our minority investment in Scale AI, along with other investment activities. We ended the quarter with $47.1 billion in cash and marketable securities and $28.8 billion in debt. Moving now to our segment results. I'll begin with our Family of Apps segment. Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow, and we estimate more than 3.4 billion people used at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in June. Q2 total Family of Apps revenue was $47.1 billion, up 22% year-over-year. Q2 Family of Apps ad revenue was $46.6 billion, up 21% or 22% on a constant currency basis. Within that revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth. On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Europe and Rest of World at 24% and 23%, respectively. North America and Asia Pacific grew 21% and 18%. In Q2, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 11%, with growth mainly driven by Asia Pacific. Impression growth accelerated across all regions due primarily to engagement tailwinds on both Facebook and Instagram and to a lesser extent, ad load optimizations on Facebook. The average price per ad increased 9%, benefiting from increased advertiser demand, largely driven by improved ad performance. Pricing growth slowed modestly from the first quarter due to the accelerated impression growth in Q2. Family of Apps other revenue was $583 million, up 50%, driven by WhatsApp paid messaging revenue growth as well as Meta Verified subscriptions. We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps. In Q2, Family of Apps expenses were $22.2 billion, representing 82% of our overall expenses. Family of Apps expenses were up 14% and mainly due to growth in employee compensation and infrastructure costs, partially offset by lower legal-related costs. Family of Apps operating income was $25 billion, representing a 53% operating margin. Within our Reality Labs segment, Q2 revenue was $370 million up 5% year- over-year due to increased sales of AI glasses, partially offset by lower Quest sales. Reality Labs expenses were $4.9 billion, up 1% year-over-year, driven by higher non-head count-related technology development costs. Reality Labs operating loss was $4.5 billion. Turning now to the business outlook. There are two primary factors that drive our revenue performance, our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time. On the first, daily actives continue to grow across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp as we make additional improvements to our recommendation systems and product experiences. We continue to see momentum with video engagement, in particular. In Q2, Instagram video time was up more than 20% year-over- year globally. We're seeing strong traction on Facebook as well, particularly in the U.S., where video time spent similarly expanded more than 20% year-over-year. These gains have been enabled by ongoing optimizations to our ranking systems to better identify the most relevant content to show. We expect to deliver additional improvements throughout the year as we further scale up our models and make recommendations more adaptive to a person's interests within their session. Another emphasis of our recommendations work is promoting original content. On Instagram, over 2/3 of recommended content in the U.S. now comes from original posts. In the second half, we'll be focused on further increasing the freshness of original posts, so the right audiences can discover original content from creators soon after it is posted. We are also making good progress on our longer-term ranking innovations that we expect will provide the next leg of improvements over the coming years. Our research efforts to develop cross-surface foundation recommendation models continue to progress. We are also seeing promising results from using LLM in Threads recommendation systems. The incorporation of LLMs are now driving a meaningful share of the ranking related time spent gains on Threads. We're now exploring how to extend the use of LLMs and recommendation systems to our other apps. We're leveraging Llama and several other back- end processes as well, including actioning bug reports so we can identify and resolve recurring issues more quickly and efficiently. This has resulted in top line bug reports in the U.S. and Canada in Facebook Feed and notifications dropping by roughly 30% over the past 10 months. The primary way we're using Llama in our apps today is to power Meta AI which is now available in over 200 countries and territories. WhatsApp continues to be the largest driver of queries as people message Meta AI directly for tasks such as information gathering, homework assistance and generating images. Outside of WhatsApp, we're seeing Meta AI become an increasingly valuable complement to our content discovery engines. Meta AI usage on Facebook is expanding as people use it to ask about posts they see in Feed and find content across our platform in Search. Another way we expect Meta AI will help with content discovery is through the automatic translation and dubbing of foreign language content into the audience's local language. We'll have more to share on our efforts there later this year. Moving to Reality Labs. The growth of Ray-Ban Meta sales accelerated in Q2, with demand still outstripping supply for the most popular SKUs despite increases to our production earlier this year. We're working to ramp supply to better meet consumer demand later this year. Now to the second driver of our revenue performance, increasing monetization efficiency. The first part of this work is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement. We continue to optimize ad supply across each surface to better deliver ads at the time and place they are most relevant to people. In Q2, we also began introducing ads within Feed on Threads and the Updates tab of WhatsApp, which is a separate space away from people's chats. As of May, advertisers globally can now run video and image ads to Threads users in most countries, including the United States. While ad supply remains low and Threads is not expected to be a meaningful contributor to overall impression growth in the near term, we are optimistic about the longer-term opportunity with Threads as the community and engagement grow and monetization scales. On WhatsApp, we are rolling out ads in status and channels, along with channel subscriptions in the Updates tab to help businesses reach the more than 1.5 billion daily actives who visit that part of the app. We expect the introduction of ads and status will be gradual over the course of this year and next, with low levels of expected ad supply initially. We also expect WhatsApp ads and status to earn a lower average price than Facebook or Instagram ads for the foreseeable future, due in part towards WhatsApp skew toward lower monetizing markets, and more limited information that can be used for targeting. Given this, we do not expect ads and status to be a meaningful contributor to total impressions or revenue growth for the next few years. The second part of increasing monetization efficiency is improving marketing performance. There are three areas of this work that I'll focus on today, improving our ad systems, advancing our ads products, including by building tools that assist in ads creation and evolving our ads platform to drive results that are optimized for each business' objectives. First is our ad systems where we're innovating in both the ads retrieval and ranking stages to serve more relevant ads to people. A lot of this work involves us continuing to advance the modeling innovations we've introduced previously while expanding their adoption across our platform. The Andromeda model architecture we began introducing in the second half of 2024 powers the ads retrieval stage of our ad system, where we select the few thousand most relevant ads from tens of millions of potential candidates. In Q2, we made enhancements to Andromeda that enabled it to select more relevant and more personalized ads candidates while also expanding coverage to Facebook Reels. These improvements have driven nearly 4% higher conversions on Facebook Mobile Feed and Reels. Our new Generative Ads Recommendation system, or GEM, powers the ranking stage of our ad system, which is the part of the process after ads retrieval where we determine which ads to show someone from candidates suggested by our retrieval engine. In Q2, we improved the performance of GEM by further scaling our training capacity and adding organic and ads engagement data on Instagram. We also incorporated new advanced sequence modeling techniques that helped us double the length of event sequences we use, enabling our systems to consider a longer history of the content or ads that a person has engaged with in order to provide better ad selections. The combination of these improvements increased ad conversions by approximately 5% on Instagram and 3% on Facebook Feed and Reels in Q2. Finally, we expanded coverage of our Lattice model architecture in Q2. We first began deploying Lattice in 2023 with our later-stage ads ranking efforts, allowing us to run significantly larger models that generalize learnings across objectives and surfaces in place of numerous smaller ads models that have historically been optimized for individual objectives and surfaces. In April, we began deploying Lattice to earlier-stage ads ranking models as well. This is leading not only to greater capacity and engineering efficiency but also improved performance with the recent Lattice deployments driving a nearly 4% increase in ad conversions across Facebook Feed and Reels in Q2. Next, ad products. Here, we're seeing strong momentum with our Advantage+ suite of AI-powered solutions. In Q2, we completed the rollout of our streamlined campaign creation flow for Advantage+ sales and app campaigns, which makes it easier for advertisers to realize the performance benefits from Advantage+ by having it turned on at the beginning. We've seen lifts in advertiser adoption of sales and app campaigns since we've expanded availability and are working to complete the rollout for leads campaigns in the coming months. Within our Advantage+ Creative suite, adoption of genAI ad creative tools continues to broaden. Nearly 2 million advertisers are now using our video generation features, image animation and video expansion, and we're seeing strong results with our text generation tools as we continue to add new features. In Q2, we started testing AI-powered translation so that advertisers can automatically translate the caption of their ads to 10 different languages. While it's early, we have seen promising performance lifts in our prelaunch tests. We're also continuing to see strong adoption of image expansion among small- and medium-sized advertisers, which speaks to how these tools help businesses who have fewer resources to develop creative. With larger advertisers, we expect agencies will continue to be valuable partners in helping apply these new tools to drive performance. Outside of Advantage+, we're seeing good momentum in business messaging, particularly in the U.S., where click to message revenue grew more than 40% year-over-year in Q2. The strong U.S. growth is benefiting from a ramp in adoption of our website to message ads, which drive people to a business's website for more information before choosing to launch a chat with the business in one of our messaging apps. Finally, we continue to evolve our ads platform to drive results that are optimized for each business' objectives and the way they measure results. In Q2, we completed the global rollout of our incremental attribution feature, which is the only product on the market that optimizes for and reports on incremental conversions, which are conversions that would not have happened without a person seeing the ad. We also launched omnichannel ads globally in Q2 and which enable advertisers to optimize for incremental sales, both in-store and online with just one campaign. In tests, advertisers using omnichannel ads have seen a median 15% reduction in total cost per purchase compared to website- only optimization. Next, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. Our primary focus remains investing capital back into the business with infrastructure and talent being our top priorities. I'll start with hiring. Our approach to adding head count continues to be targeted at the company's highest priority areas. We expect talent additions across all of our priority areas will continue to drive overall head count growth through this year and 2026. While head count growth in our other functions remains constrained, within AI, we've had a particular emphasis on recruiting leading talent within the industry, as we build out Meta Superintelligence Labs to accelerate our AI model development and product initiatives. Next, infrastructure. We expect having sufficient compute capacity will be central to realizing many of the largest opportunities in front of us over the coming years. We continue to see very compelling returns from our AI capacity investments in our core ads and organic engagement initiatives and expect to continue investing significantly there in 2026. We also expect that developing leading AI infrastructure will be a core advantage in developing the best AI models and product experiences. So we expect to ramp our investments significantly in 2026 to support that work. Moving to our financial outlook. We expect third quarter 2025 total revenue to be in the range of $47.5 billion to $50.5 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is an approximately 1% tailwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates. While we are not providing an outlook for fourth quarter revenue, we would expect our year-over-year growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2025 to be slower than the third quarter as we lap a period of stronger growth in the fourth quarter of 2024. Turning now to the expense outlook. We expect full year 2025 total expenses to be in the range of $114 billion to $118 billion, narrowed from our prior outlook of $113 billion to $118 billion and reflecting a growth rate of 20% to 24% year-over-year. While we're still very early in planning for next year, there are a few factors we expect will provide meaningful upward pressure on our 2026 total expense growth rate. The largest single driver of growth will be infrastructure costs, driven by a sharp acceleration in depreciation expense growth and higher operating costs as we continue to scale up our infrastructure fleet. Aside from infrastructure, we expect the second largest driver of growth to be employee compensation as we add technical talent in priority areas and recognize a full year of compensation expenses for employees hired throughout 2025. We expect these factors will result in a 2026 year-over-year expense growth rate that is above the 2025 expense growth rate. Turning now to the CapEx outlook. We currently expect 2025 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to be in the range of $66 billion to $72 billion, narrowed from our prior outlook of $64 billion to $72 billion and up approximately $30 billion year-over-year at the midpoint. While the infrastructure planning process remains highly dynamic, we currently expect another year of similarly significant CapEx dollar growth in 2026 as we continue aggressively pursuing opportunities to bring additional capacity online to meet the needs of our AI efforts and business operations. On to tax. With the enactment of the new U.S. tax law, we anticipate a reduction in our U.S. federal cash tax for the remainder of the current year and future years. There are several alternative ways of implementing the provisions of the act, which we are currently evaluating. While we estimate that the 2025 tax rate will be higher than our Q2 tax rate, we cannot quantify the magnitude at this time. In addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU that could significantly impact our business and our financial results. For example, we continue to engage with the European Commission on our Less Personalized Ads offering or LPA, which we introduced in November 2024 and based on feedback from the European Commission in connection with the DMA. As the commission provides further feedback on LPA, we cannot rule out that it may seek to impose further modifications to it that would result in a materially worse user and advertiser experience. This could have a significant negative impact on our European revenue as early as later this quarter. We have appealed the European Commission's DMA decision, but any modifications to our model may be imposed during the appeal process. In closing, this was another strong quarter for our business as our investments in infrastructure and technical talent continue to improve core ads performance and engagement on our platforms. We expect the significant investments we're making now will allow us to continue leveraging advances in AI to extend those gains and unlock a new set of opportunities in the years to come. With that, Krista, let's open up the call for questions. Question and Answer",

      "text": "Founder, Chairman & CEO Yes, sure. I can start. At a high level, I think that there are all these questions that people have about what are going to be the time lines to get to really strong AI or superintelligence or whatever you want to call it. And I guess that each step along the way so far, we've observed the more kind of aggressive assumptions, or the fastest assumptions have been the ones that have most accurately predicted what would happen. And I think that, that just continued to happen over the course of this year, too. And so I've given a number of those anecdotes on these earnings calls in the past. And I think, certainly, some of the work that we're seeing with teams internally being able to adapt Llama 4 to build autonomous AI agents that can help improve the Facebook algorithm to increase quality and engagement are like -- I mean, that's like a fairly profound thing if you think about it. I mean it's happening in low volume right now. So I'm not sure that, that result by itself was a major contributor to this quarter's earnings or anything like that. But I think the trajectory on this stuff is very optimistic. And I think it's one of the interesting challenges in running a business like this now is there's just a very high chance it seems like the world is going to look pretty different in a few years from now. And on the one hand, there are all these things that we can do, there are improvements to our core products that exist. And then I think we have this principle that we believe in across the company, which we tell people take superintelligence seriously. And the basic principle is this idea that we think that this is going to really shape all of our systems sooner rather than later, not necessarily on the trajectory of a quarter or 2, but on the trajectory of a few years. And I think that that's just going to change a lot of the assumptions around how different things work across the company. So anyway, I think it's basically just what we're continually observing how this works and what the trajectory or the pace of AI progress has been. I think it continues to be on the faster end. And that I think informs a lot of the decisions from everything from the importance and value of having the absolute best and most elite talent-dense team at the company to making sure that we have a leading compute fleet so that the people here can do -- obviously, the researchers here have more compute per person to be able to lead their research and then roll it out to billions of people across our products, making sure that we build and drive these products through all of the different things that we do, which I think is one of the things that our company is the best in the world at is basically when we take a technology, we're good at driving that through all of our apps and our ad systems and all that stuff, it's not just going to kind of sit on the vine. I think that there's no other company, I think that is as good as us at kind of taking something and kind of getting it in front of billions of people. So yes, I mean, we're just going to push very aggressively on all of that. But at some level, yes, this is -- there's sort of a bet in the trajectory that we're seeing and those are the signals that we're seeing. But we're just trying to read it.",

      "text": "Chief Financial Officer Eric, for the second part of your question, we haven't, in fact, kicked off our budgeting process for 2026. So thinking about next year, there are clearly many, many moving pieces in a very dynamic operating environment. But there are certain aspects that we have some visibility into today, including the rough shape of our 2026 infrastructure plans. And that flows through into our expense expectations next year. And we also have some visibility into the compensation expense growth that we'll recognize from the AI talent that we're hiring this year. And so those two things are part of why we gave a little bit of an early preview into the expectations for growth for 2026 total expenses as well as for 2026 CapEx. So on the total expenses side, as I mentioned, we expect infrastructure will be the single largest contributor to 2026 expense growth. That's driven primarily by a sharp acceleration in depreciation expense growth in 2026, largely driven by recognizing incremental depreciation from assets that we purchased and place in service in '26 as well as from infrastructure deployed through 2025 that will recognize a full year of depreciation next year. We also expect a greater mix of our CapEx to be in shorter-lived assets in 2025 and '26 than it has been in prior years. And then the other component of infra cost growth next year would come from higher operating expenses, including energy costs, leases, maintenance and operational expenses that are associated with maintaining that fleet. And we also expect some increased spend on cloud services in '26 to meet our capacity needs as well as growth in network-related costs. So a lot going on, on the infrastructure side as it contributes to the 2026 total expense number. After that, employee compensation is the next largest driver of expense growth in '26. Again, driven primarily in the investments that we're making in technical talent, including recognizing a full year of compensation expense for the AI talent we hire this year. I realize this answer is getting a little long, so I'll try to wrap up quickly. On the CapEx side, the big driver of our increased CapEx in '26 will be scaling genAI capacity as we build out training capacity that's going to drive higher spend across servers, networking, data centers next year. We also expect that we're going to continue investing significantly in core AI in 2026. And again, this is a pretty -- a very dynamic area of planning, but we wanted to share kind of our early thoughts as things are shaping up.",

      "text": "Founder, Chairman & CEO Yes, sure. I mean in terms of the research agenda and a bunch of the areas that we're very focused on, I do think focusing on self-improvement is a very important area of research. And there's obviously different scaling paradigms, and I don't want to get too much into the detail of research that we're doing on this. But I think that for developing superintelligence, at some level, you're not just going to be learning from people because you're trying to build something that is fundamentally smarter than people. So it's going to need to learn how to -- or you're going to need to develop a way for it to be able to improve itself. So that, I think, is a very fundamental thing. That is going to have a very broad implications for how we build products, how we run the company, new things that we can invent, new discoveries that can be made, society more broadly. I think that that's just a very fundamental part of this. In terms of the shape of the effort overall, I guess I've just gotten a little bit more convinced around the ability for small talent-dense teams to be the optimal configuration for driving frontier research. And it's a bit of a different setup than we have on our other world-class machine learning system. So if you look at like what we do in Instagram or Facebook or our ad system, we can very productively have many hundreds or thousands of people basically working on improving those systems, and we have very well- developed systems for kind of individuals to run tests and be able to test a bunch of different things. You don't need every researcher there to have the whole system in their head. But I think for this -- for the leading research on superintelligence, you really want the smallest group that can hold the whole thing in their head, which drives, I think, some of the physics around the team size and how -- and the dynamics around how that works.

One is we're focused on making recommendations even more adaptive to what a person is engaging with during their session so that the recommendations we surface are the most relevant to what they're interested in at that moment. And we're making optimizations to help the best content from smaller creators break-out by matching it to the right audiences sooner after it gets posted. And we're also working on improving the ability for our systems to discover more diversified and niche interest for each person through interest exploration and learning explicit user preferences. We're also planning to scale up our models further and incorporate more advanced techniques that should improve the overall quality of recommendations. But we also have a lot of long-term bets in the hopper around areas like developing foundational models that will support recommendations across multiple services. Incorporating LLMs more deeply into our recommendation systems. And a big focus of this work is going to be on optimizing the systems to make them more efficient.

We've always open sourced some of our models and not open sourced everything that we've done. So I would expect that we will continue to produce and share leading open source models. I also think that there are a couple of trends that are playing out. One is that we're getting models that are so big that they're just not practical for a lot of other people to use. So it's -- we would kind of wrestle with whether it's productive or helpful to share that or if that's really just primarily helping competitors or something like that.

And then obviously, as you approach real superintelligence, I think there is a whole different set of safety concerns that I think we need to take very seriously, that I wrote about in my note this morning.

Right now, we are focused on ensuring that we have enough capacity for our internal use cases, which includes both all of the core AI work that we do to support the recommendation engine work on the organic content side to support all the ads ranking and recommendation work. And then, of course, to make sure that we are building the training capacity that we think we need in order to build frontier AI models. And to make sure that we're preparing ourselves for the types of inference use cases that we think might -- that we might have ahead of us as we eventually focus not only on developing frontier models, but also how we can expand into the kinds of consumer use cases that we think will be hopefully widely useful and engaging for our users. So at present, we're not really thinking about external use cases on the infrastructure, but it's a good question. On your second question, which is really around the sort of ROI on CapEx, there are a couple of things. So again, on the core AI side, we continue to see strong ROI. Our ability to measure that is quite good, and we feel sort of very good about the rigorous measurement and returns that we see there. On the genAI side, we are clearly much, much earlier on the return curve and we don't expect that the genAI work is going to be a meaningful driver of revenue this year or next year. But we remain generally very optimistic about the monetization opportunities that will open up, and Mark spoke to them in his script, the sort of five pillars, so I won't repeat them here. And we think that over the medium- to long-term time frame, those are opportunities that are very adjacent and intuitive for where -- in terms of where our business is today, why they would be big opportunities for us and that there will be sort of big markets attached to each of them. So we, again, are also, I would say -- the last thing I would add here is we are building the infrastructure with fungibility in mind. Obviously, there are a lot of things that you have to build up front in terms of the data center shells, the networking infrastructure, et cetera. But we will be ordering servers, which ultimately will be the biggest bulk of CapEx spend as we need them and when we need them and making sort of the best decisions at those times in terms of figuring out where the capacity will go to use.",

Is it really against kind of those five pillars you outlined above? Or should we be thinking more broadly? And Susan, obviously AI delivering great ROI today, all those investments and also building towards kind of longer-term goals, just curious, has there just been any change or adjustment to how you think about the relationship between revenues or core business performance and the cadence of investment?",

      "text": "Founder, Chairman & CEO Yes, in terms of what to look at, I mean, what I'm going to look at internally, the quality of the people on the teams, the quality of the models that we're producing, the rate of improvement of our other AI systems across the company and the extent to which the leading kind of foundation models that we're building contribute to improving all of the other AI systems and kind of everything that we're doing around the company. Then I think you just get into our standard product and business playbook, which is translating that technology into new products, which will first scale to billions of people and then over time, we will monetize. But I think that there's going to be some lag in that, right? And that, I think, is kind of always the way that we work is, whether we're building some new social product or this, something like Meta AI or a new product around this, we're going to work on getting to leading scale, building the highest quality product, focused on that for a few years. And then once we're really confident in that position, then we'll focus on ramping up the business around it. So it's -- I mean, going back to the last question a little bit, it's sort of when you compare this business to some of the cloud businesses, it's like we do have this delay where we focus on building research and then doing research and then ramping consumer products, and it often does take some period of time before we really are ramping up the business around it. I think that's kind of a known property of our business and the cycle around it. But I guess, on the flip side, we believe that if you are building superintelligence, you should use all of your GPUs to make it so that you're serving your customers really well with that. And we think that there's going to be a much higher return than we can do by generating that directly rather than just kind of renting or leasing out the infrastructure at other companies.",

And it won't be linear. In some years, we'll deliver above-average profit growth. And in years where we're making big investments, I think we will see that impact the amount of operating profit growth that we can deliver. And at the moment, we see a lot of attractive investment opportunities that we believe are going to set us up to deliver compelling profit growth in the coming years for all of our investors. And so we're focused on constraining investments elsewhere as we pursue those investments. But we really believe that this is a time for us to really make investments in the future of AI as I think it will open up both new opportunities for us in addition to strengthen our core business.",

So it's -- yes, you focus on specific areas, but in general, it just sort of gets better at a lot of different things that people want to ask it or want to do with it. And I think with each version, both like what we're doing on a week-to-week basis in terms of continuing to train it, and when we drop kind of new generations or big dot releases of each generation, that will improve engagement, too. So we're focused on that. I'm not going to go into the specific research areas or capabilities that we're planning on dropping in the future. But obviously, I'm pretty excited about it.",

And has that new computational platform that you've talked about in the past, is it moving faster or slower than you thought? And as you leverage Meta AI, do you believe glasses ultimately replace smartphones? Or do you need the new form factor that's AI first? And then, Susan, just quickly, how do you guys see SBC progressing over the next couple of years? Is it fair to assume it will grow materially faster than the revenue and OpEx?

      "text": "Founder, Chairman & CEO Yes, I can talk a bit about the glasses. Yes, I mean, I'm very excited about the progress that we're making. I think both the Ray-Ban Metas and I'm very excited about the Oakley Meta, the HSTNs too. And other things that we have planned. Yes, I mean, this product category is clearly doing quite well. And I think it's good for a lot of things. It is stylish eyewear, so people like wearing them just as glasses. It has a bunch of interesting functionality. And then the use of Meta AI in them just continues to grow, and the percent of people who are using it for that on a daily basis is increasing, and that's all good to see. I mean, I continue to think that glasses are basically going to be the ideal form factor for AI because you can let an AI see what you see throughout the day, hear what you hear, talk to you. Once you get a display in there, whether it's the kind of wide holographic field of view like we showed with Orion or just a smaller display that might be good for displaying some information, and that's also going to unlock a lot of value where you can just interact with an AI system throughout the day in this multimodal way. It can see the content around you, it can generate a UI for you, show you information and be helpful. I mean, I personally think that just like if -- I wear contact lenses, I feel like if I didn't have my vision corrected, I'd be sort of at a cognitive disadvantage going through the world. And I think in the future, if you don't have glasses that have AI or some way to interact with AI, I think you're kind of similarly, probably be at a pretty significant cognitive disadvantage compared to other people and who you're working with, or competing against. So I think that this is a pretty fundamental form factor. There are a lot of different versions of it. Right now, we're building ones that I think are stylish, but aren't focused on the display. I think there's a whole set of different things to explore with displays. This is kind of what we've been maxing out with Reality Labs over the last 5 to 10 years is basically doing the research on all of these different things. And it's a -- I don't know, 10 years ago, I would have -- like the other thing that's awesome about glasses is, they are going to be the ideal way to blend the physical and digital worlds together. So the whole metaverse vision, I think, is going to end up being extremely important, too, and AI is going to accelerate that, too. It -- just that if you'd asked me 5 years ago, whether we'd have kind of holograms that created immersive experiences or superintelligence first, I think most people would have thought that you'd get the holograms first. And it's this interesting kind of quirk of the tech industry that I think we're going to end up having really strong AI first. But because we've been investing in this, I think we're just several years ahead on building out glasses. And I think that that's something that we're excited to keep on investing in heavily because I think it's going to be a really important part of the future.",

Those are obviously a big driver of 2026 expense growth as we recognize the full year of compensation for the additional talent we're bringing on. Having said that, so we factored that into our sort of expense outlook. Having said that, we certainly -- we are very focused on making sure on keeping an eye on dilution.
