With that,\nlet me turn the call over to Colette.\n\nColette M. Kress\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Stewart. Q3 was another record quarter. We continue to deliver\nincredible growth. Revenue of $35.1 billion was up 17% sequentially and up\n94% year-on-year and well above our outlook of $32.5 billion. All market\nplatforms posted strong sequential and year-over-year growth, fueled by the\nadoption of NVIDIA accelerated computing and AI.\n\nStarting with Data Center. Another record was achieved in Data Center.\nRevenue of $30.8 billion, up 17% sequential and up 112% year-on-year.\nNVIDIA Hopper demand is exceptional, and sequentially, NVIDIA H200 sales\nincreased significantly to double-digit billions, the fastest prod ramp in\nour company's history. The H200 delivers up to 2x faster inference\nperformance and up to 50% improved TCO. Cloud service providers were\napproximately half of our Data Center sales with revenue increasing more\nthan 2x year-on-year.\n\nCSPs deployed NVIDIA H200 infrastructure and high-speed networking with\ninstallations scaling to tens of thousands of GPUs to grow their business\nand serve rapidly rising demand for AI training and inference workloads.\nNVIDIA H200-powered cloud instances are now available from AWS, CoreWeave\nand Microsoft Azure with Google Cloud and OCI coming soon. Alongside\nsignificant growth from our large CSPs, NVIDIA GPU regional cloud revenue\njumped 2x year-on-year as North America, India, and Asia Pacific regions\nramped NVIDIA Cloud instances and sovereign cloud build-outs.\n\nConsumer Internet revenue more than doubled year-on-year as companies\nscaled their NVIDIA Hopper infrastructure to support next-generation AI\nmodels, training, multimodal and agentic AI, deep learning recommender\nengines, and generative AI inference and content creation workloads.\nNVIDIA's Ampere and Hopper infrastructures are fueling inference revenue\ngrowth for customers. NVIDIA is the largest inference platform in the\nworld. Our large installed base and rich software ecosystem encourage\ndevelopers to optimize for NVIDIA and deliver continued performance and TCO\nimprovements.\n\nRapid advancements in NVIDIA software algorithms boosted Hopper inference\nthroughput by an incredible 5x in 1 year and cut time to first token by 5x.\nOur upcoming release of NVIDIA NIM will boost Hopper inference performance\nby an additional 2.4x. Continuous performance optimizations are a hallmark\nof NVIDIA and drive increasingly economic returns for the entire NVIDIA\ninstalled base.\n\nBlackwell is in full production after a successfully executed mask change.\nWe shipped 13,000 GPU samples to customers in the third quarter, including\none of the first Blackwell DGX engineering samples to OpenAI. Blackwell is\na full stack, full infrastructure, AI data center scale system with\ncustomizable configurations needed to address a diverse and growing AI\nmarket from x86 to ARM, training to inferencing GPUs, InfiniBand to\nEthernet switches, and NVLink and from liquid cooled to air cooled, every\ncustomer is racing to be the first to market.\n\nBlackwell is now in the hands of all of our major partners, and they are\nworking to bring up their data centers. We are integrating Blackwell\nsystems into the diverse data center configurations of our customers.\nBlackwell demand is staggering, and we are racing to scale supply to meet\nthe incredible demand customers are placing on us. Customers are gearing up\nto deploy Blackwell at scale. Oracle announced the world's first Zettascale\nAI cloud computing clusters that can scale to over 131,000 Blackwell GPUs\nto help enterprises train and deploy some of the most demanding next-\ngeneration AI models.\n\nYesterday, Microsoft announced they will be the first CSP to offer, in\nprivate preview, Blackwell-based cloud instances powered by NVIDIA GB200\nand Quantum InfiniBand. Last week, Blackwell made its debut on the most\nrecent round of MLPerf training results, sweeping the per GPU benchmarks\nand delivering a 2.2x leap in performance over Hopper. The results also\ndemonstrate our relentless pursuit to drive down the cost of compute. The\n64 Blackwell GPUs are required to run the GPT-3 benchmark compared to 256\nH100s or a 4x reduction in cost.\n\nNVIDIA Blackwell architecture with NVLink Switch enables up to 30x faster\ninference performance and a new level of inference scaling, throughput and\nresponse time that is excellent for running new reasoning inference\napplications like OpenAI's o1 model. With every new platform shift, a wave\nof start-ups is created. Hundreds of AI-native companies are already\ndelivering AI services with great success.\n\nThrough Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI are the headliners. Anthropic,\nPerplexity, Mistral, Adobe Firefly, Runway, Midjourney, Lightricks, Harvey,\nCodeium, Cursor and the Bridge are seeing great success while thousands of\nAI-native start-ups are building new services. The next wave of AI are\nenterprise AI and industrial AI. Enterprise AI is in full throttle. NVIDIA\nAI Enterprise, which includes NVIDIA NeMo and NIM microservices is an\noperating platform of agentic AI. Industry leaders are using NVIDIA AI to\nbuild Copilots and agents.\n\nWorking with NVIDIA, Cadence, Cloudera, Cohesity, NetApp, Nutanix,\nSalesforce, SAP and ServiceNow are racing to accelerate development of\nthese applications with the potential for billions of agents to be deployed\nin the coming years. Consulting leaders like Accenture and Deloitte are\ntaking NVIDIA AI to the world's enterprises. Accenture launched a new\nbusiness group with 30,000 professionals trained on NVIDIA AI technology to\nhelp facilitate this global build-out.\n\nAdditionally, Accenture with over 770,000 employees, is leveraging NVIDIA-\npowered agentic AI applications internally, including 1 case that cuts\nmanual steps in marketing campaigns by 25% to 35%. Nearly 1,000 companies\nare using NVIDIA NIM, and the speed of its uptake is evident in NVIDIA AI\nenterprise monetization. We expect NVIDIA AI enterprise full year revenue\nto increase over 2x from last year and our pipeline continues to build.\nOverall, our software, service and support revenue is annualizing at $1.5\nbillion, and we expect to exit this year annualizing at over $2 billion.\n\nIndustrial AI and robotics are accelerating. This is triggered by\nbreakthroughs in physical AI, foundation models that understand the\nphysical world, like NVIDIA NeMo for enterprise AI agents. We built NVIDIA\nOmniverse for developers to build, train, and operate industrial AI and\nrobotics. Some of the largest industrial manufacturers in the world are\nadopting NVIDIA Omniverse to accelerate their businesses, automate their\nworkflows, and to achieve new levels of operating efficiency. Foxconn, the\nworld's largest electronics manufacturer, is using digital twins and\nindustrial AI built on NVIDIA Omniverse to speed the bring-up of its\nBlackwell factories and drive new levels of efficiency. In its Mexico\nfacility alone, Foxconn expects to reduce -- a reduction of over 30% in\nannual kilowatt hour usage.\n\nFrom a geographic perspective, our data center revenue in China grew\nsequentially due to shipments of export-compliant Hopper products to\nindustries. As a percentage of total data center revenue, it remained well\nbelow levels prior to the onset of export controls. We expect the market in\nChina to remain very competitive going forward. We will continue to comply\nwith export controls while serving our customers.\n\nOur sovereign AI initiatives continue to gather momentum as countries\nembrace NVIDIA accelerated computing for a new industrial revolution\npowered by AI. India's leading CSPs include product communications and\nYotta Data Services are building AI factories for tens of thousands of\nNVIDIA GPUs. By year-end, they will have boosted NVIDIA GPU deployments in\nthe country by nearly 10x. Infosys, TSE (sic) [ TCS ], Wipro are adopting\nNVIDIA AI enterprise and upskilling nearly 0.5 million developers and\nconsultants to help clients build and run AI agents on our platform.\n\nIn Japan, SoftBank is building the nation's most powerful AI supercomputer\nwith NVIDIA DGX Blackwell and Quantum InfiniBand. SoftBank is also\npartnering with NVIDIA to transform the telecommunications network into a\ndistributed AI network with NVIDIA AI Aerial and AI-RAN platform that can\nprocess both 5G RAN on AI on CUDA. We are launching the same in the U.S.\nwith T-Mobile. Leaders across Japan, including Fujitsu, NEC and NTT are\nadopting NVIDIA AI Enterprise and major consulting companies, including EY\nStrategy and Consulting will help bring NVIDIA AI technology to Japan's\nindustries.\n\nNetworking revenue increased 20% year-on-year. Areas of sequential revenue\ngrowth include InfiniBand and Ethernet switches, SmartNICs and BlueField\nDPUs. Though networking revenue was sequentially down, networking demand is\nstrong and growing, and we anticipate sequential growth in Q4. CSPs and\nsupercomputing centers are using and adopting the NVIDIA InfiniBand\nplatform to power new H200 clusters. NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet for AI\nrevenue increased over 3x year-on-year. And our pipeline continues to build\nwith multiple CSPs and consumer Internet companies planning large cluster\ndeployments.\n\nTraditional Ethernet was not designed for AI. NVIDIA Spectrum-X uniquely\nleverages technology previously exclusive to InfiniBand to enable customers\nto achieve massive scale of their GPU compute. Utilizing Spectrum-X, xAI's\nColossus 100,000 Hopper supercomputer experienced 0 application latency\ndegradation and maintained 95% data throughput versus 60% for traditional\nEthernet.\n\nNow moving to Gaming and AI PCs. Gaming revenue of $3.3 billion increased\n14% sequentially and 15% year-on-year. Q3 was a great quarter for Gaming\nwith notebook, console, and desktop revenue all growing sequentially and\nyear-on-year. RTX end demand was fueled by strong back-to-school sales as\nconsumers continue to choose GeForce RTX GPUs and devices to power gaming,\ncreative and AI applications.\n\nChannel inventory remains healthy and we are gearing up for the holiday\nseason. We began shipping new GeForce RTX AI PC with up to 321 AI TOPS from\nASUS and MSI with Microsoft's Copilot+ capabilities anticipated in Q4.\nThese machines harness the power of RTX ray tracing and AI technologies to\nsupercharge gaming, photo, and video editing, image generation and coding.\n\nThis past quarter, we celebrated the 25th anniversary of the GeForce 256,\nthe world's first GPU. The transforming executing graphics to igniting the\nAI revolution. NVIDIA's GPUs have been the driving force behind some of the\nmost consequential technologies of our time.\n\nMoving to ProViz. Revenue of $486 million was up 7% sequentially and 17%\nyear-on-year. NVIDIA RTX workstations continue to be the preferred choice\nto power professional graphics, design, and engineering-related workloads.\nAdditionally, AI is emerging as a powerful demand driver, including\nautonomous vehicle simulation, generative AI model prototyping for\nproductivity-related use cases and generative AI content creation in media\nand entertainment.\n\nMoving to Automotive. Revenue was a record $449 million, up 30%\nsequentially and up 72% year-on-year. Strong growth was driven by self-\ndriving brands of NVIDIA Orin and robust end market demand for NAVs. Volvo\nCars is rolling out its fully electric SUV built on NVIDIA Orin and\nDriveOS.\n\nOkay. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin was 74.6% and non-\nGAAP gross margin was 75%, down sequentially, primarily driven by a mix\nshift of the H100 systems to more complex and higher-cost systems within\nData Center. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating\nexpenses were up 9% due to higher compute, infrastructure and engineering\ndevelopment costs for new product introductions.\n\nIn Q3, we returned $11.2 billion to shareholders in the form of share\nrepurchases and cash dividends. Well, let me turn to the outlook for the\nfourth quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $37.5 billion, plus or\nminus 2%, which incorporates continued demand for Hopper architecture and\nthe initial ramp of our Blackwell products. While demand greatly exceed\nsupply, we are on track to exceed our previous Blackwell revenue estimate\nof several billion dollars as our visibility into supply continues to\nincrease.\n\nOn Gaming, although sell-through was strong in Q3, we expect fourth quarter\nrevenue to decline sequentially due to supply constraints. GAAP and non-\nGAAP gross margins are expected to be 73% and 73.5%, respectively, plus or\nminus 50 basis points. Blackwell is a customizable AI infrastructure with 7\ndifferent types of NVIDIA-built chips, multiple networking options and for\nair and liquid-cooled data centers. Our current focus is on ramping to\nstrong demand, increasing system availability, and providing the optimal\nmix of configurations to our customer.\n\nAs Blackwell ramps, we expect gross margins to moderate to the low 70s.\nWhen fully ramped, we expect Blackwell margins to be in the mid-70s. GAAP\nand non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4.8\nbillion and $3.4 billion, respectively. We are a data center-scale AI\ninfrastructure company. Our investments include building data centers for\ndevelopment of our hardware and software stacks and to support new\nintroductions. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to\nbe an income of approximately $400 million, excluding gains and losses from\nnonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be\n16.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial\ndetails are included in the CFO commentary and other information available\non our IR website.\n\nIn closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community.\nWe will be attending the UBS Global Technology and AI Conference on\nDecember 3 in Scottsdale. Please join us at CES in Las Vegas, where Jensen\nwill deliver a keynote on January 6. And we will host a Q&A session for\nfinancial analysts the next day on January 7.\nOur earnings call to discuss results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025\nis scheduled for February 26, 2025. We will now open the call for\nquestions. Operator, can you poll for questions, please?\n\nQuestion and Answer\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of C.J.\nMuse of Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\nChristopher James Muse\nCantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division\n\nI guess, Jensen, a question for you on the debate around whether scaling\nfor large language models have stalled. Obviously, we're very early here,\nbut would love to hear your thoughts on this front. How are you helping\nyour customers as they work through these issues? And then obviously, part\nof the context here is we're discussing clusters that have yet to benefit\nfrom Blackwell. So is this driving even greater demand for Blackwell?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nFoundation model pretraining scaling is intact and it's continuing. As you\nknow, this is an empirical law, not a fundamental physical law. But the\nevidence is that it continues to scale. What we're learning, however, is\nthat it's not enough, that we've now discovered 2 other ways to scale. One\nis post-training scaling. Of course, the first generation of post-training\nwas reinforcement learning human feedback, but now we have reinforcement\nlearning AI feedback and all forms of synthetic data generated data that\nassists in post-training scaling.\n\nAnd one of the biggest events and one of the most exciting developments is\nStrawberry, ChatGPT o1, OpenAI's o1, which does inference time scaling,\nwhat's called test time scaling. The longer it thinks, the better and\nhigher-quality answer it produces. And it considers approaches like chain\nof thought and multi-path planning and all kinds of techniques necessary to\nreflect and so on and so forth. And it's -- intuitively, it's a little bit\nlike us doing thinking in our head before we answer your question.\n\nAnd so we now have 3 ways of scaling and we're seeing all 3 ways of\nscaling. And as a result of that, the demand for our infrastructure is\nreally great. You see now that at the tail end of the last generation of\nfoundation models were at about 100,000 Hoppers. The next generation starts\nat 100,000 Blackwells. And so that kind of gives you a sense of where the\nindustry is moving with respect to pretraining scaling, post-training\nscaling, and then now very importantly, inference time scaling. And so the\ndemand is really great for all of those reasons.\n\nBut remember, simultaneously, we're seeing inference really starting to\nscale up for our company. We are the largest inference platform in the\nworld today because our installed base is so large. And everything that was\ntrained on Amperes and Hoppers inference incredibly on Amperes and Hoppers.\nAnd as we move to Blackwells for training foundation models, it leads\nbehind it a large installed base of extraordinary infrastructure for\ninference.\n\nAnd so we're seeing inference demand go up. We're seeing inference time\nscaling go up. We see the number of AI-native companies continue to grow.\nAnd of course, we're starting to see enterprise adoption of agentic AI\nreally is the latest rage. And so we're seeing a lot of demand coming from\na lot of different places.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs.\n\nToshiya Hari\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\n\nJensen, you executed the mass change earlier this year. There were some\nreports over the weekend about some heating issues. On the back of this,\nwe've had investors ask about your ability to execute to the road map you\npresented at GTC this year with Ultra coming out next year and the\ntransition to Rubin in '26. Can you sort of speak to that? And some\ninvestors are questioning that, so if you can sort of speak to your ability\nto execute on time, that would be super helpful.\n\nAnd then a quick part B. On supply constraints, is it a multitude of\ncomponentry that's causing this or is it specifically CoWoS, HBM? Is it\nsupply constraints? Are the supply constraints getting better? Are they\nworsening? Any sort of color on that would be super helpful as well.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nYes, thanks. So let's see. Back to the first question. Blackwell production\nis in full steam. In fact, as Colette mentioned earlier, we will deliver\nthis quarter more Blackwells than we had previously estimated. And so the\nsupply chain team is doing an incredible job working with our supply\npartners to increase Blackwell, and we're going to continue to work hard to\nincrease Blackwell through next year.\n\nIt is the case that demand exceeds our supply. And that's expected as we're\nin the beginnings of this generative AI revolution as we all know. And\nwe're at the beginning of a new generation of foundation models that are\nable to do reasoning and able to do long thinking. And of course, one of\nthe really exciting areas is physical AI, AI that now understands the\nstructure of the physical world. And so Blackwell demand is very strong.\nOur execution is going well.\n\nAnd there's obviously a lot of engineering that we're doing across the\nworld. You see now systems that are being stood up by Dell and CoreWeave. I\nthink you saw systems from Oracle stood up. You have systems from\nMicrosoft, and they're about to preview their Grace Blackwell systems. You\nhave systems that are at Google. And so all of these CSPs are racing to be\nfirst. The engineering that we do with them is, as you know, rather\ncomplicated.\n\nAnd the reason for that is because although we build full stack and full\ninfrastructure, we disaggregate all of this AI supercomputer and we\nintegrate it into all of the custom data centers and architectures around\nthe world. That integration process, it's something we've done several\ngenerations now. We're very good at it but still there's still a lot of\nengineering that happens at this point.\n\nBut as you see from all of the systems that are being stood up, Blackwell\nis in great shape. And as we mentioned earlier, the supply and what we're\nplanning to ship this quarter is greater than our previous estimates. With\nrespect to the supply chain, there are 7 different chips, 7 custom chips\nthat we built in order for us to deliver the Blackwell systems. The\nBlackwell systems go in air-cooled or liquid-cooled, NVLink 8 or NVLink 72\nor NVLink 8, NVLink 36, NVLink 72. We have x86 or Grace. And the\nintegration of all of those systems into the world's data centers is\nnothing short of a miracle. And so the component supply chain necessary to\nramp at this scale, you have to go back and take a look at how much\nBlackwell we shipped last quarter, which was 0. And in terms of how much\nBlackwell total systems will ship this quarter, which is measured in\nbillions, the ramp is incredible.\n\nAnd so almost every company in the world seems to be involved in our supply\nchain. And we've got great partners, everybody from, of course, TSMC and\nAmphenol, the connector company, incredible company. Vertiv and SK Hynix\nand Micron, [ Spill ], Amkor, KYEC, and there's Foxconn and the factories\nthat they've built and Quanta and Wiwynn and, gosh, Dell and HP, and Super\nMicro, Lenovo and the number of companies is just really quite incredible,\nQuanta. And I'm sure I've missed partners that are involved in the ramping\nof Blackwell, which I really appreciate. And so anyways, I think we're in\ngreat shape with respect to the Blackwell ramp at this point.\n\nAnd then lastly, your question about our execution of our road map. We're\non an annual road map and we're expecting to continue to execute on our\nannual road map. And by doing so, we increased the performance, of course,\nof our platform. But it's also really important to realize that when we're\nable to increase performance and do so at X factors at a time, we're\nreducing the cost of training. We're reducing the cost of inferencing.\nWe're reducing the cost of AI so that it could be much more accessible.\n\nBut the other factor that's very important to note is that when there's a\ndata center of some fixed size and the data center always is of some fixed\nsize. It could be, of course, tens of megawatts in the past, and now it's --\n most data centers are now 100 megawatts to several hundred megawatts, and\nwe're planning on gigawatt data centers, it doesn't really matter how large\nthe data centers are. The power is limited. And when you're in the power-\nlimited data center, the best -- the highest performance per watt\ntranslates directly into the highest revenues for our partners.\n\nAnd so on the one hand, our annual road map reduces cost. But on the other\nhand, because our perf per watt is so good compared to anything out there,\nwe generate for our customers the greatest possible revenues. And so that\nannual rhythm is really important to us, and we have every intentions of\ncontinuing to do that. And everything is on track as far as I know.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri of UBS.\n\nTimothy Michael Arcuri\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\n\nI'm wondering if you can talk about the trajectory of how Blackwell is\ngoing to ramp this year. I know Jensen, you did just talk about Blackwell\nbeing better than I think you had said several billions of dollars in\nJanuary. It sounds like you're going to do more than that. But I think in\nrecent months also, you said that Blackwell crosses over Hopper in the\nApril quarter. So I guess I had 2 questions.\n\nFirst of all, is that still the right way to think about it, that Blackwell\nwill cross over Hopper in April? And then Colette, you kind of talked about\nBlackwell bringing down gross margin to the low 70s as it ramps. So I guess\nif April is the crossover, is that the worst of the pressure on gross\nmargin? So you're going to be kind of in the low 70s as soon as April. I'm\njust wondering if you can sort of shape that for us.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nColette, why don't you start?\n\nColette M. Kress\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nSure, let me first start with your question, Tim, thank you, regarding our\ngross margins. And we discussed that our gross margins as we are ramping\nBlackwell in the very beginning and the many different configurations, the\nmany different chips that we are bringing to market, we are going to focus\non making sure we have the best experience for our customers as they stand\nthat up.\n\nWe will start growing into our gross margins but we do believe those will\nbe in the low 70s in that first part of the ramp. So you're correct, as you\nlook at the quarters following after that, we will start increasing our\ngross margins, and we hope to get to the mid-70s quite quickly as part of\nthat round.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nHopper demand will continue through next year, surely the first several\nquarters of the next year. And meanwhile, we will ship more Blackwells next\nquarter than this, and we'll ship more Blackwells the quarter after that\nthan our first quarter. And so that kind of puts it in perspective. We are\nreally at the beginnings of 2 fundamental shifts in computing that is\nreally quite significant.\n\nThe first is moving from coding that runs on CPUs to machine learning that\ncreates neural networks that runs on GPUs. And that fundamental shift from\ncoding to machine learning is widespread at this point. There are no\ncompanies who are not going to do machine learning. And so machine learning\nis also what enables generative AI. And so on the one hand, the first thing\nthat's happening is $1 trillion worth of computing systems and data centers\naround the world is now being modernized for machine learning.\n\nOn the other hand, secondarily, I guess, is that on top of these systems\nare going to be -- we're going to be creating a new type of capability\ncalled AI. And when we say generative AI, we're essentially saying that\nthese data centers are really AI factories. They're generating something.\nJust like we generate electricity, we're now going to be generating AI. And\nif the number of customers is large, just as the number of consumers of\nelectricity is large, these generators are going to be running 24/7. And\ntoday, many AI services are running 24/7, just like an AI factory.\n\nAnd so we're going to see this new type of system come online, and I call\nit an AI factory because that's really as close to what it is. It's unlike\na data center of the past. And so these 2 fundamental trends are really\njust beginning. And so we expect this to happen, this growth, this\nmodernization and the creation of a new industry to go on for several\nyears.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America\nSecurities.\n\nVivek Arya\nBofA Securities, Research Division\n\nColette, just to clarify, do you think it's a fair assumption to think\nNVIDIA could recover to kind of mid-70s gross margin in the back half of\ncalendar '25? Just wanted to clarify that. And then Jensen, my main\nquestion, historically, when we have seen hardware deployment cycles, they\nhave inevitably included some digestion along the way. When do you think we\nget to that phase? Or is it just too premature to discuss that because\nyou're just at the start of Blackwell?\n\nSo how many quarters of shipments do you think is required to kind of\nsatisfy this first wave? Can you continue to grow this into calendar '26?\nJust how should we be prepared to see what we have seen historically,\nright, a period of digestion along the way of a long-term kind of secular\nhardware deployment?\n\nColette M. Kress\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nOkay. Vivek, thank you for the question. Let me clarify your question\nregarding gross margins. Could we reach the mid-70s in the second half of\nnext year? And yes, I think it is a reasonable assumption or goal for us to\ndo, but we'll just have to see how that mix of ramp goes. But yes, it is\ndefinitely possible.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nThe way to think through that, Vivek, is I believe that there will be no\ndigestion until we modernize $1 trillion with the data centers. Those -- if\nyou just look at the world's data centers, the vast majority of it is built\nfor a time when we wrote applications by hand and we ran them on CPUs. It's\njust not a sensible thing to do anymore. If you have -- if every company's\nCapEx, if they're ready to build data center tomorrow, they ought to build\nit for a future of machine learning and generative AI because they have\nplenty of old data centers.\n\nAnd so what's going to happen over the course of the next X number of\nyears, and let's assume that over the course of 4 years, the world's data\ncenters could be modernized as we grow into IT, as you know, IT continues\nto grow about 20%, 30% a year, let's say. And so -- but let's say by 2030,\nthe world's data centers for computing is, call it, a couple of trillion\ndollars. We have to grow into that. We have to modernize the data center\nfrom coding to machine learning. That's number one.\n\nThe second part of it is generative AI. And we're now producing a new type\nof capability the world's never known, a new market segment that the\nworld's never had. If you look at OpenAI, it didn't replace anything. It's\nsomething that's completely brand new. It's in a lot of ways as when the\niPhone came, it was completely brand new. It wasn't really replacing\nanything. And so we're going to see more and more companies like that. And\nthey're going to create and generate, out of their services, essentially\nintelligence.\n\nSome of it would be digital artist intelligence like Runway. Some of it\nwould be basic intelligence like OpenAI. Some of it would be legal\nintelligence like Harvey. Digital marketing intelligence like [ Writers ],\nso on and so forth. And the number of these companies, these -- what are\nthey called, AI-native companies, are just in hundreds. And almost every\nplatform shift, there was -- there were Internet companies, as you recall.\nThere were cloud-first companies. There were mobile-first companies. Now\nthey're AI natives.\n\nAnd so these companies are being created because people see that there's a\nplatform shift, and there's a brand-new opportunity to do something\ncompletely new. And so my sense is that we're going to continue to build\nout to modernize IT, modernize computing, number one; and then number two,\ncreate these AI factories that are going to be for a new industry for the\nproduction of artificial intelligence.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein\nResearch.\n\nStacy Aaron Rasgon\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\n\nColette, I had a clarification and a question for you. The clarification,\njust when you say low 70s gross margins, does -- is 73.5% count as low 70s\nor do you have something else in mind? And for my question, you're guiding\ntotal revenues, and so I mean, total data center revenues in the next\nquarter must be up \"several billion dollars.\" But it sounds like Blackwell\nnow should be up more than that.\n\nBut you also said Hopper was still strong, so like is Hopper down\nsequentially next quarter? And if it is, like why? Is it because of the\nsupply constraints? Is -- China has been pretty strong. Is China is kind of\nrolling off a bit into Q4? So any color you can give us on sort of the\nBlackwell ramp and the Blackwell versus Hopper behavior into Q4 would be\nreally helpful.\n\nColette M. Kress\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nSo first, starting on your first question there, Stacy, regarding our gross\nmargin and define low. Low, of course, is below the mids and let's say, we\nmight be at 71%, maybe about 72%, 72.5%. We're going to be in that range.\nWe could be higher than that as well. We're just going to have to see how\nit comes through. We do want to make sure that we are ramping and\ncontinuing that improvement, the improvement in terms of our yields, the\nimprovement in terms of the product as we go through the rest of the year.\nSo we'll get up to the mid-70s by that point.\n\nThe second statement was a question regarding our Hopper and what is our\nHopper doing? We have seen substantial growth for H200 not only in terms of\norders but the quickness in terms of those that are standing that out. It\nis an amazing product and it's the fastest growing and ramping that we've\nseen. We will continue to be selling Hopper in this quarter, in Q4 for\nsure. That is across the board in terms of all of our different\nconfigurations, and our configurations include what we may do in terms of\nChina.\n\nBut keep that in mind that folks are also, at the same time, looking to\nbuild out their Blackwell. So we've got a little bit of both happening in\nQ4. But yes, is it possible for Hopper to grow between Q3 and Q4? It's\npossible but we'll just have to see.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley.\n\nJoseph Lawrence Moore\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\n\nGreat. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in\nthe inference market. You've talked about Strawberry and some of the\nramifications of longer scaling inference projects. But you've also talked\nabout the possibility that as some of these Hopper clusters age that you\ncould use some of the Hopper latent chips for inference. So I guess do you\nexpect inference to outgrow training in the next kind of 12 months time\nframe? And just generally, your thoughts there.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nOur hopes and dreams is that someday, the world does a ton of inference.\nAnd that's when AI has really exceeded is when every single company is\ndoing inference inside their companies for the marketing department and\nforecasting department and supply chain group and their legal department\nand engineering, of course, and coding of course. And so we hope that every\ncompany is doing inference 24/7.\n\nAnd that there will be a whole bunch of AI native startups, thousands of AI\nnative startups that are generating tokens and generating AI. And every\naspect of your computer experience from using Outlook to PowerPointing or\nwhen you're sitting there with Excel, you're constantly generating tokens.\nAnd every time you read a PDF, open a PDF, it generated a whole bunch of\ntokens. One of my favorite applications is NotebookLM, this Google\napplication that came out. I use the living daylights out of it just\nbecause it's fun.\n\nAnd I put every PDF, every archived paper into it just to listen to it as\nwell as scanning through it. And so I think that's the goal is to train\nthese models so that people use it. And there's now a whole new era of AI,\nif you will, a whole new genre of AI called physical AI, just those large\nlanguage models understand the human language and how the thinking process,\nif you will. Physical AI understands the physical world. And it understands\nthe meaning of the structure and understands what's sensible and what's not\nand what could happen and what won't.\n\nAnd not only does it understand but it can predict, roll out a short\nfuture. That capability is incredibly valuable for industrial AI and\nrobotics. And so that's fired up so many AI native companies and robotics\ncompanies and physical AI companies that you're probably hearing about. And\nit's really the reason why we built Omniverse. Omniverse is so that we can\nenable these AIs to be created and learn in Omniverse and learn from\nsynthetic data generation and reinforcement, learning physics feedback\ninstead of just a human feedback, it's now physics feedback. To have these\ncapabilities, Omniverse was created so that we can enable physical AI.\n\nAnd so that -- the goal is to generate tokens. The goal is to inference,\nand we're starting to see that growth happening. So I'm super excited about\nthat. Now let me just say one more thing. Inference is super hard. And the\nreason why inference is super hard is because you need the accuracy to be\nhigh on the one hand. You need the throughput to be high so that the cost\ncould be as low as possible, but you also need the latency to be low.\n\nAnd computers that are high-throughput as well as low latency is incredibly\nhard to build. And these applications have long context lengths because\nthey want to understand. They want to be able to inference within\nunderstanding the context of what they're being asked to do. And so the\ncontext length is growing larger and larger. On the other hand, the models\nare getting larger. They're multimodality.\n\nJust the number of dimensions that inference is innovating is incredible.\nAnd this innovation rate is what makes NVIDIA's architecture so great\nbecause we -- our ecosystem is fantastic. Everybody knows that if they\ninnovate on top of CUDA and top of NVIDIA's architecture, they can innovate\nmore quickly and they know that everything should work. And if something\nwere to happen, it's probably likely their code and not ours.\n\nAnd so that ability to innovate in every single direction at the same time,\nhaving a large installed base so that whatever you create could land on an\nNVIDIA computer and be deployed broadly all around the world in every\nsingle data center all the way out to the edge into robotic systems, that\ncapability is really quite phenomenal.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo.\n\nAaron Christopher Rakers\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\n\nI wanted to ask you, as we kind of focus on the Blackwell cycle and think\nabout the Data Center business. When I look at the results this last\nquarter, Colette, you mentioned that obviously, the networking business was\ndown about 15% sequentially. But then your comments were that you were\nseeing very strong demand. You mentioned also that you had multiple cloud\nCSP design wins for these large-scale clusters. So I'm curious if you could\nunpack what's going on in the Networking business and where maybe you've\nseen some constraints and just your confidence in the pace of Spectrum-X\nprogressing to that multiple billions of dollars that you previously had\ntalked about.\n\nColette M. Kress\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nLet's first start with the networking. The growth year-over-year is\ntremendous. And our focus since the beginning of our acquisition of\nMellanox has really been about building together the work that we do in\nterms of in the data center. The networking is such a critical part of\nthat. Our ability to sell our networking with many of our systems that we\nare doing in data center is continuing to grow and do quite well.\n\nSo this quarter is just a slight dip down and we're going to be right back\nup in terms of growing. We're getting ready for Blackwell and more and more\nsystems that will be using not only our existing networking but also the\nnetworking that is going to be incorporated in a lot of these large systems\nwe are providing them to.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Atif Malik of Citi.\n\nAtif Malik\nCitigroup Inc., Research Division\n\nI have 2 quick ones for Colette. Colette, on the last earnings call, you\nmentioned that sovereign demand is in low double-digit billions. Can you\nprovide an update on that? And then can you explain the supply-constrained\nsituation in gaming? Is that because you're shifting your supply towards\ndata center?\n\nColette M. Kress\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nSo first starting in terms of sovereign AI, such an important part of\ngrowth, something that is really surfaced with the onset of generative AI\nand building models in the individual countries around the world. And we\nsee a lot of them, and we talked about a lot of them on the call today and\nthe work that they are doing. So our sovereign AI and our pipeline going\nforward is still absolutely intact as those are working to build these\nfoundational models in their own language, in their own culture, and\nworking in terms of the enterprises within those countries.\n\nAnd I think you'll continue to see this be growth opportunities that you\nmay see with our regional clouds that are being stood up and/or those that\nare focusing in terms of AI factories for many parts of the sovereign AI.\nThis is areas where this is growing not only in terms of in Europe, but\nyou're also seeing this in terms of growth in terms of in the Asia Pac as\nwell.\n\nLet me flip to your second question that you asked regarding Gaming. So our\nGaming right now from a supply, we're busy trying to make sure that we can\nramp all of our different products. And in this case, our gaming supply,\ngiven what we saw selling through was moving quite fast. Now the challenge\nthat we have is how fast could we get that supply getting ready into the\nmarket for this quarter. Not to worry, I think we'll be back on track with\nmore supply as we turn the corner into the new calendar year. We're just\ngoing to be tight for this quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes of Melius Research.\n\nBenjamin Alexander Reitzes\nMelius Research LLC\n\nI wanted to ask Colette and Jensen with regard to sequential growth. So\nvery strong sequential growth this quarter, and you're guiding to about 7%.\nDo your comments on Blackwell imply that we reaccelerate from there as you\nget more supply? Just in the first half, it would seem that there would be\nsome catch-ups. So I was wondering how prescriptive you could be there.\n\nAnd then, Jensen, just overall with the change in administration that's\ngoing to take place here in the U.S. and the China situation, have you\ngotten any sense or any conversations about tariffs or anything with regard\nto your China business? Any sense of what may or may not go on? It's\nprobably too early but wondering if you had any thoughts there.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nWe guide 1 quarter at a time.\n\nColette M. Kress\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nWe are working right now on the quarter that we're in and building what we\nneed to ship in terms of Blackwell. We have every supplier on the planet\nworking seamlessly with us to do that. And once we get to next quarter,\nwe'll help you understand in terms of that ramp that we'll see to the next\nquarter going after that.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nWhatever the new administration decides, we will, of course, support the\nadministration. And that's our -- the highest mandate. And then after that,\ndo the best we can and just as we always do. And so we have to\nsimultaneously and we will comply with any regulation that comes along\nfully and support our customers to the best of our abilities and to compete\nin the marketplace. We'll do all of these 3 things simultaneously.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu of New Street\nResearch.\n\nPierre C. Ferragu\nNew Street Research LLP\n\nJensen, you mentioned in your comments, you have the pretraining, the\nactual language models and you have reinforcement learning that becomes\nmore and more important in training and inference as well and then you have\ninference itself. And I was wondering if you have a sense like a high-level\ntypical sense of out of an overall AI ecosystem, like maybe one of your\nclients or one of the large models that are out there. Today, how much of\nthe compute goes into each of these buckets? How much for the pretraining?\nHow much for the reinforcement? And how much into inference today? Do you\nhave any sense for how it's splitting and where the growth is the most\nimportant as well?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nWell, today, it's vastly in pretraining a foundation model because, as you\nknow, post-training, the new technologies are just coming online. And\nwhatever you could do in pretraining and post-training, you would try to do\nso that the inference cost could be as low as possible for everyone.\nHowever, there are only so many things that you could do a priority. And so\nyou'll always have to do on-the-spot thinking and in context thinking and a\nreflection.\n\nAnd so I think that the fact that all 3 are scaling is actually very\nsensible based on where we are. And in the area foundation model, now we\nhave multimodality foundation models and the amount of petabytes video that\nthese foundation models are going to be trained on, it's incredible. And so\nmy expectation is that for the foreseeable future, we're going to be\nscaling pretraining, post-training as well as inference time scaling and\nwhich is the reason why I think we're going to need more and more compute.\nAnd we're going to have to drive as hard as we can to keep increasing the\nperformance by X factors out of time so that we can continue to drive down\nthe cost and continue to increase the revenues and get the AI revolution\ngoing.\n\nOperator\n\nI'll now turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nThank you. The tremendous growth in our business is being fueled by 2\nfundamental trends that are driving global adoption of NVIDIA computing.\nFirst, the computing stack is undergoing a reinvention, a platform shift\nfrom coding to machine learning, from executing code on CPUs to processing\nneural networks on GPUs. The $1 trillion installed base of traditional data\ncenter infrastructure is being rebuilt for Software 2.0, which applies\nmachine learning to produce AI.\n\nSecond, the age of AI is in full steam. Generative AI is not just a new\nsoftware capability but a new industry with AI factories manufacturing\ndigital intelligence, a new industrial revolution that can create a multi-\ntrillion-dollar AI industry. Demand for Hopper and anticipation for\nBlackwell, which is now in full production, are incredible for several\nreasons. There are more foundation model makers now than there were a year\nago.\n\nThe computing scale of pretraining and post-training continues to grow\nexponentially. There are more AI native startups than ever and the number\nof successful inference services is rising. And with the introduction of\nChatGPT o1, OpenAI o1, a new scaling law called test-time scaling has\nemerged. All of these consume a great deal of computing. AI is transforming\nevery industry, company and country. Enterprises are adopting agentic AI to\nrevolutionize workflows. Over time, AI coworkers will assist employees in\nperforming their jobs faster and better.\n\nInvestments in industrial robotics are surging due to breakthroughs in\nphysical AI, driving new training infrastructure demand as researchers\ntrain world foundation models on petabytes of video and Omniverse\nsynthetically generated data. The age of robotics is coming. Countries\nacross the world recognize the fundamental AI trends we are seeing and have\nawakened to the importance of developing their national AI infrastructure.\n\nThe age of AI is upon us and it's large and diverse. NVIDIA's expertise,\nscale, and ability to deliver full stack and full infrastructure lets us\nserve the entire multi-trillion-dollar AI and robotics opportunities ahead\nfrom every hyperscale cloud, enterprise private cloud to sovereign regional\nAI clouds, on-prem to industrial edge and robotics. Thanks for joining us\ntoday, and catch up next time.\n\nOperatorThis concludes today's conference call.

  "presentation_text": "Operator\n\nGood afternoon. My name is Jail, and I'll be your conference operator\ntoday. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to NVIDIA's third\nquarter earnings call. [Operator Instructions]\n\nThank you. Stewart Stecker, you may begin your conference.\n\nStewart Stecker\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference\ncall for the third quarter of fiscal 2025. With me today from NVIDIA are\nJensen Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Colette Kress,\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\n\nI'd like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's\nInvestor Relations website. The webcast will be available for replay until\nthe conference call to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter\nof fiscal 2025. The content of today's call is NVIDIA's property. It can't\nbe reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.\n\nDuring this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current\nexpectations. These are subject to a number of significant risks and\nuncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a\ndiscussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and\nbusiness, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our\nmost recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q, and the reports that we may file on Form 8-\nK with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All our statements are made\nas of today, November 20, 2024, based on information currently available to\nus. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such\nstatements.\n\nDuring this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find\na reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial\nmeasures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website. With that,\nlet me turn the call over to Colette.\n\nColette M. Kress\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Stewart. Q3 was another record quarter. We continue to deliver\nincredible growth. Revenue of $35.1 billion was up 17% sequentially and up\n94% year-on-year and well above our outlook of $32.5 billion. All market\nplatforms posted strong sequential and year-over-year growth, fueled by the\nadoption of NVIDIA accelerated computing and AI.\n\nStarting with Data Center. Another record was achieved in Data Center.\nRevenue of $30.8 billion, up 17% sequential and up 112% year-on-year.\nNVIDIA Hopper demand is exceptional, and sequentially, NVIDIA H200 sales\nincreased significantly to double-digit billions, the fastest prod ramp in\nour company's history. The H200 delivers up to 2x faster inference\nperformance and up to 50% improved TCO. Cloud service providers were\napproximately half of our Data Center sales with revenue increasing more\nthan 2x year-on-year.\n\nCSPs deployed NVIDIA H200 infrastructure and high-speed networking with\ninstallations scaling to tens of thousands of GPUs to grow their business\nand serve rapidly rising demand for AI training and inference workloads.\nNVIDIA H200-powered cloud instances are now available from AWS, CoreWeave\nand Microsoft Azure with Google Cloud and OCI coming soon. Alongside\nsignificant growth from our large CSPs, NVIDIA GPU regional cloud revenue\njumped 2x year-on-year as North America, India, and Asia Pacific regions\nramped NVIDIA Cloud instances and sovereign cloud build-outs.\n\nConsumer Internet revenue more than doubled year-on-year as companies\nscaled their NVIDIA Hopper infrastructure to support next-generation AI\nmodels, training, multimodal and agentic AI, deep learning recommender\nengines, and generative AI inference and content creation workloads.\nNVIDIA's Ampere and Hopper infrastructures are fueling inference revenue\ngrowth for customers. NVIDIA is the largest inference platform in the\nworld. Our large installed base and rich software ecosystem encourage\ndevelopers to optimize for NVIDIA and deliver continued performance and TCO\nimprovements.\n\nRapid advancements in NVIDIA software algorithms boosted Hopper inference\nthroughput by an incredible 5x in 1 year and cut time to first token by 5x.\nOur upcoming release of NVIDIA NIM will boost Hopper inference performance\nby an additional 2.4x. Continuous performance optimizations are a hallmark\nof NVIDIA and drive increasingly economic returns for the entire NVIDIA\ninstalled base.\n\nBlackwell is in full production after a successfully executed mask change.\nWe shipped 13,000 GPU samples to customers in the third quarter, including\none of the first Blackwell DGX engineering samples to OpenAI. Blackwell is\na full stack, full infrastructure, AI data center scale system with\ncustomizable configurations needed to address a diverse and growing AI\nmarket from x86 to ARM, training to inferencing GPUs, InfiniBand to\nEthernet switches, and NVLink and from liquid cooled to air cooled, every\ncustomer is racing to be the first to market.\n\nBlackwell is now in the hands of all of our major partners, and they are\nworking to bring up their data centers. We are integrating Blackwell\nsystems into the diverse data center configurations of our customers.\nBlackwell demand is staggering, and we are racing to scale supply to meet\nthe incredible demand customers are placing on us. Customers are gearing up\nto deploy Blackwell at scale. Oracle announced the world's first Zettascale\nAI cloud computing clusters that can scale to over 131,000 Blackwell GPUs\nto help enterprises train and deploy some of the most demanding next-\ngeneration AI models.\n\nYesterday, Microsoft announced they will be the first CSP to offer, in\nprivate preview, Blackwell-based cloud instances powered by NVIDIA GB200\nand Quantum InfiniBand. Last week, Blackwell made its debut on the most\nrecent round of MLPerf training results, sweeping the per GPU benchmarks\nand delivering a 2.2x leap in performance over Hopper. The results also\ndemonstrate our relentless pursuit to drive down the cost of compute. The\n64 Blackwell GPUs are required to run the GPT-3 benchmark compared to 256\nH100s or a 4x reduction in cost.\n\nNVIDIA Blackwell architecture with NVLink Switch enables up to 30x faster\ninference performance and a new level of inference scaling, throughput and\nresponse time that is excellent for running new reasoning inference\napplications like OpenAI's o1 model. With every new platform shift, a wave\nof start-ups is created. Hundreds of AI-native companies are already\ndelivering AI services with great success.\n\nThrough Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI are the headliners. Anthropic,\nPerplexity, Mistral, Adobe Firefly, Runway, Midjourney, Lightricks, Harvey,\nCodeium, Cursor and the Bridge are seeing great success while thousands of\nAI-native start-ups are building new services. The next wave of AI are\nenterprise AI and industrial AI. Enterprise AI is in full throttle. NVIDIA\nAI Enterprise, which includes NVIDIA NeMo and NIM microservices is an\noperating platform of agentic AI. Industry leaders are using NVIDIA AI to\nbuild Copilots and agents.\n\nWorking with NVIDIA, Cadence, Cloudera, Cohesity, NetApp, Nutanix,\nSalesforce, SAP and ServiceNow are racing to accelerate development of\nthese applications with the potential for billions of agents to be deployed\nin the coming years. Consulting leaders like Accenture and Deloitte are\ntaking NVIDIA AI to the world's enterprises. Accenture launched a new\nbusiness group with 30,000 professionals trained on NVIDIA AI technology to\nhelp facilitate this global build-out.\n\nAdditionally, Accenture with over 770,000 employees, is leveraging NVIDIA-\npowered agentic AI applications internally, including 1 case that cuts\nmanual steps in marketing campaigns by 25% to 35%. Nearly 1,000 companies\nare using NVIDIA NIM, and the speed of its uptake is evident in NVIDIA AI\nenterprise monetization. We expect NVIDIA AI enterprise full year revenue\nto increase over 2x from last year and our pipeline continues to build.\nOverall, our software, service and support revenue is annualizing at $1.5\nbillion, and we expect to exit this year annualizing at over $2 billion.\n\nIndustrial AI and robotics are accelerating. This is triggered by\nbreakthroughs in physical AI, foundation models that understand the\nphysical world, like NVIDIA NeMo for enterprise AI agents. We built NVIDIA\nOmniverse for developers to build, train, and operate industrial AI and\nrobotics. Some of the largest industrial manufacturers in the world are\nadopting NVIDIA Omniverse to accelerate their businesses, automate their\nworkflows, and to achieve new levels of operating efficiency. Foxconn, the\nworld's largest electronics manufacturer, is using digital twins and\nindustrial AI built on NVIDIA Omniverse to speed the bring-up of its\nBlackwell factories and drive new levels of efficiency. In its Mexico\nfacility alone, Foxconn expects to reduce -- a reduction of over 30% in\nannual kilowatt hour usage.\n\nFrom a geographic perspective, our data center revenue in China grew\nsequentially due to shipments of export-compliant Hopper products to\nindustries. As a percentage of total data center revenue, it remained well\nbelow levels prior to the onset of export controls. We expect the market in\nChina to remain very competitive going forward. We will continue to comply\nwith export controls while serving our customers.\n\nOur sovereign AI initiatives continue to gather momentum as countries\nembrace NVIDIA accelerated computing for a new industrial revolution\npowered by AI. India's leading CSPs include product communications and\nYotta Data Services are building AI factories for tens of thousands of\nNVIDIA GPUs. By year-end, they will have boosted NVIDIA GPU deployments in\nthe country by nearly 10x. Infosys, TSE (sic) [ TCS ], Wipro are adopting\nNVIDIA AI enterprise and upskilling nearly 0.5 million developers and\nconsultants to help clients build and run AI agents on our platform.\n\nIn Japan, SoftBank is building the nation's most powerful AI supercomputer\nwith NVIDIA DGX Blackwell and Quantum InfiniBand. SoftBank is also\npartnering with NVIDIA to transform the telecommunications network into a\ndistributed AI network with NVIDIA AI Aerial and AI-RAN platform that can\nprocess both 5G RAN on AI on CUDA. We are launching the same in the U.S.\nwith T-Mobile. Leaders across Japan, including Fujitsu, NEC and NTT are\nadopting NVIDIA AI Enterprise and major consulting companies, including EY\nStrategy and Consulting will help bring NVIDIA AI technology to Japan's\nindustries.\n\nNetworking revenue increased 20% year-on-year. Areas of sequential revenue\ngrowth include InfiniBand and Ethernet switches, SmartNICs and BlueField\nDPUs. Though networking revenue was sequentially down, networking demand is\nstrong and growing, and we anticipate sequential growth in Q4. CSPs and\nsupercomputing centers are using and adopting the NVIDIA InfiniBand\nplatform to power new H200 clusters. NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet for AI\nrevenue increased over 3x year-on-year. And our pipeline continues to build\nwith multiple CSPs and consumer Internet companies planning large cluster\ndeployments.\n\nTraditional Ethernet was not designed for AI. NVIDIA Spectrum-X uniquely\nleverages technology previously exclusive to InfiniBand to enable customers\nto achieve massive scale of their GPU compute. Utilizing Spectrum-X, xAI's\nColossus 100,000 Hopper supercomputer experienced 0 application latency\ndegradation and maintained 95% data throughput versus 60% for traditional\nEthernet.\n\nNow moving to Gaming and AI PCs. Gaming revenue of $3.3 billion increased\n14% sequentially and 15% year-on-year. Q3 was a great quarter for Gaming\nwith notebook, console, and desktop revenue all growing sequentially and\nyear-on-year. RTX end demand was fueled by strong back-to-school sales as\nconsumers continue to choose GeForce RTX GPUs and devices to power gaming,\ncreative and AI applications.\n\nChannel inventory remains healthy and we are gearing up for the holiday\nseason. We began shipping new GeForce RTX AI PC with up to 321 AI TOPS from\nASUS and MSI with Microsoft's Copilot+ capabilities anticipated in Q4.\nThese machines harness the power of RTX ray tracing and AI technologies to\nsupercharge gaming, photo, and video editing, image generation and coding.\n\nThis past quarter, we celebrated the 25th anniversary of the GeForce 256,\nthe world's first GPU. The transforming executing graphics to igniting the\nAI revolution. NVIDIA's GPUs have been the driving force behind some of the\nmost consequential technologies of our time.\n\nMoving to ProViz. Revenue of $486 million was up 7% sequentially and 17%\nyear-on-year. NVIDIA RTX workstations continue to be the preferred choice\nto power professional graphics, design, and engineering-related workloads.\nAdditionally, AI is emerging as a powerful demand driver, including\nautonomous vehicle simulation, generative AI model prototyping for\nproductivity-related use cases and generative AI content creation in media\nand entertainment.\n\nMoving to Automotive. Revenue was a record $449 million, up 30%\nsequentially and up 72% year-on-year. Strong growth was driven by self-\ndriving brands of NVIDIA Orin and robust end market demand for NAVs. Volvo\nCars is rolling out its fully electric SUV built on NVIDIA Orin and\nDriveOS.\n\nOkay. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin was 74.6% and non-\nGAAP gross margin was 75%, down sequentially, primarily driven by a mix\nshift of the H100 systems to more complex and higher-cost systems within\nData Center. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating\nexpenses were up 9% due to higher compute, infrastructure and engineering\ndevelopment costs for new product introductions.\n\nIn Q3, we returned $11.2 billion to shareholders in the form of share\nrepurchases and cash dividends. Well, let me turn to the outlook for the\nfourth quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $37.5 billion, plus or\nminus 2%, which incorporates continued demand for Hopper architecture and\nthe initial ramp of our Blackwell products. While demand greatly exceed\nsupply, we are on track to exceed our previous Blackwell revenue estimate\nof several billion dollars as our visibility into supply continues to\nincrease.\n\nOn Gaming, although sell-through was strong in Q3, we expect fourth quarter\nrevenue to decline sequentially due to supply constraints. GAAP and non-\nGAAP gross margins are expected to be 73% and 73.5%, respectively, plus or\nminus 50 basis points. Blackwell is a customizable AI infrastructure with 7\ndifferent types of NVIDIA-built chips, multiple networking options and for\nair and liquid-cooled data centers. Our current focus is on ramping to\nstrong demand, increasing system availability, and providing the optimal\nmix of configurations to our customer.\n\nAs Blackwell ramps, we expect gross margins to moderate to the low 70s.\nWhen fully ramped, we expect Blackwell margins to be in the mid-70s. GAAP\nand non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4.8\nbillion and $3.4 billion, respectively. We are a data center-scale AI\ninfrastructure company. Our investments include building data centers for\ndevelopment of our hardware and software stacks and to support new\nintroductions. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to\nbe an income of approximately $400 million, excluding gains and losses from\nnonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be\n16.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial\ndetails are included in the CFO commentary and other information available\non our IR website.\n\nIn closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community.\nWe will be attending the UBS Global Technology and AI Conference on\nDecember 3 in Scottsdale. Please join us at CES in Las Vegas, where Jensen\nwill deliver a keynote on January 6. And we will host a Q&A session for\nfinancial analysts the next day on January 7.\nOur earnings call to discuss results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025\nis scheduled for February 26, 2025. We will now open the call for\nquestions. Operator, can you poll for questions, please?",
  "qa_text": "Operator\n\n[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of C.J.\nMuse of Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\nChristopher James Muse\nCantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division\n\nI guess, Jensen, a question for you on the debate around whether scaling\nfor large language models have stalled. Obviously, we're very early here,\nbut would love to hear your thoughts on this front. How are you helping\nyour customers as they work through these issues? And then obviously, part\nof the context here is we're discussing clusters that have yet to benefit\nfrom Blackwell. So is this driving even greater demand for Blackwell?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nFoundation model pretraining scaling is intact and it's continuing. As you\nknow, this is an empirical law, not a fundamental physical law. But the\nevidence is that it continues to scale. What we're learning, however, is\nthat it's not enough, that we've now discovered 2 other ways to scale. One\nis post-training scaling. Of course, the first generation of post-training\nwas reinforcement learning human feedback, but now we have reinforcement\nlearning AI feedback and all forms of synthetic data generated data that\nassists in post-training scaling.\n\nAnd one of the biggest events and one of the most exciting developments is\nStrawberry, ChatGPT o1, OpenAI's o1, which does inference time scaling,\nwhat's called test time scaling. The longer it thinks, the better and\nhigher-quality answer it produces. And it considers approaches like chain\nof thought and multi-path planning and all kinds of techniques necessary to\nreflect and so on and so forth. And it's -- intuitively, it's a little bit\nlike us doing thinking in our head before we answer your question.\n\nAnd so we now have 3 ways of scaling and we're seeing all 3 ways of\nscaling. And as a result of that, the demand for our infrastructure is\nreally great. You see now that at the tail end of the last generation of\nfoundation models were at about 100,000 Hoppers. The next generation starts\nat 100,000 Blackwells. And so that kind of gives you a sense of where the\nindustry is moving with respect to pretraining scaling, post-training\nscaling, and then now very importantly, inference time scaling. And so the\ndemand is really great for all of those reasons.\n\nBut remember, simultaneously, we're seeing inference really starting to\nscale up for our company. We are the largest inference platform in the\nworld today because our installed base is so large. And everything that was\ntrained on Amperes and Hoppers inference incredibly on Amperes and Hoppers.\nAnd as we move to Blackwells for training foundation models, it leads\nbehind it a large installed base of extraordinary infrastructure for\ninference.\n\nAnd so we're seeing inference demand go up. We're seeing inference time\nscaling go up. We see the number of AI-native companies continue to grow.\nAnd of course, we're starting to see enterprise adoption of agentic AI\nreally is the latest rage. And so we're seeing a lot of demand coming from\na lot of different places.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs.\n\nToshiya Hari\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\n\nJensen, you executed the mass change earlier this year. There were some\nreports over the weekend about some heating issues. On the back of this,\nwe've had investors ask about your ability to execute to the road map you\npresented at GTC this year with Ultra coming out next year and the\ntransition to Rubin in '26. Can you sort of speak to that? And some\ninvestors are questioning that, so if you can sort of speak to your ability\nto execute on time, that would be super helpful.\n\nAnd then a quick part B. On supply constraints, is it a multitude of\ncomponentry that's causing this or is it specifically CoWoS, HBM? Is it\nsupply constraints? Are the supply constraints getting better? Are they\nworsening? Any sort of color on that would be super helpful as well.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nYes, thanks. So let's see. Back to the first question. Blackwell production\nis in full steam. In fact, as Colette mentioned earlier, we will deliver\nthis quarter more Blackwells than we had previously estimated. And so the\nsupply chain team is doing an incredible job working with our supply\npartners to increase Blackwell, and we're going to continue to work hard to\nincrease Blackwell through next year.\n\nIt is the case that demand exceeds our supply. And that's expected as we're\nin the beginnings of this generative AI revolution as we all know. And\nwe're at the beginning of a new generation of foundation models that are\nable to do reasoning and able to do long thinking. And of course, one of\nthe really exciting areas is physical AI, AI that now understands the\nstructure of the physical world. And so Blackwell demand is very strong.\nOur execution is going well.\n\nAnd there's obviously a lot of engineering that we're doing across the\nworld. You see now systems that are being stood up by Dell and CoreWeave. I\nthink you saw systems from Oracle stood up. You have systems from\nMicrosoft, and they're about to preview their Grace Blackwell systems. You\nhave systems that are at Google. And so all of these CSPs are racing to be\nfirst. The engineering that we do with them is, as you know, rather\ncomplicated.\n\nAnd the reason for that is because although we build full stack and full\ninfrastructure, we disaggregate all of this AI supercomputer and we\nintegrate it into all of the custom data centers and architectures around\nthe world. That integration process, it's something we've done several\ngenerations now. We're very good at it but still there's still a lot of\nengineering that happens at this point.\n\nBut as you see from all of the systems that are being stood up, Blackwell\nis in great shape. And as we mentioned earlier, the supply and what we're\nplanning to ship this quarter is greater than our previous estimates. With\nrespect to the supply chain, there are 7 different chips, 7 custom chips\nthat we built in order for us to deliver the Blackwell systems. The\nBlackwell systems go in air-cooled or liquid-cooled, NVLink 8 or NVLink 72\nor NVLink 8, NVLink 36, NVLink 72. We have x86 or Grace. And the\nintegration of all of those systems into the world's data centers is\nnothing short of a miracle. And so the component supply chain necessary to\nramp at this scale, you have to go back and take a look at how much\nBlackwell we shipped last quarter, which was 0. And in terms of how much\nBlackwell total systems will ship this quarter, which is measured in\nbillions, the ramp is incredible.\n\nAnd so almost every company in the world seems to be involved in our supply\nchain. And we've got great partners, everybody from, of course, TSMC and\nAmphenol, the connector company, incredible company. Vertiv and SK Hynix\nand Micron, [ Spill ], Amkor, KYEC, and there's Foxconn and the factories\nthat they've built and Quanta and Wiwynn and, gosh, Dell and HP, and Super\nMicro, Lenovo and the number of companies is just really quite incredible,\nQuanta. And I'm sure I've missed partners that are involved in the ramping\nof Blackwell, which I really appreciate. And so anyways, I think we're in\ngreat shape with respect to the Blackwell ramp at this point.\n\nAnd then lastly, your question about our execution of our road map. We're\non an annual road map and we're expecting to continue to execute on our\nannual road map. And by doing so, we increased the performance, of course,\nof our platform. But it's also really important to realize that when we're\nable to increase performance and do so at X factors at a time, we're\nreducing the cost of training. We're reducing the cost of inferencing.\nWe're reducing the cost of AI so that it could be much more accessible.\n\nBut the other factor that's very important to note is that when there's a\ndata center of some fixed size and the data center always is of some fixed\nsize. It could be, of course, tens of megawatts in the past, and now it's --\n most data centers are now 100 megawatts to several hundred megawatts, and\nwe're planning on gigawatt data centers, it doesn't really matter how large\nthe data centers are. The power is limited. And when you're in the power-\nlimited data center, the best -- the highest performance per watt\ntranslates directly into the highest revenues for our partners.\n\nAnd so on the one hand, our annual road map reduces cost. But on the other\nhand, because our perf per watt is so good compared to anything out there,\nwe generate for our customers the greatest possible revenues. And so that\nannual rhythm is really important to us, and we have every intentions of\ncontinuing to do that. And everything is on track as far as I know.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri of UBS.\n\nTimothy Michael Arcuri\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\n\nI'm wondering if you can talk about the trajectory of how Blackwell is\ngoing to ramp this year. I know Jensen, you did just talk about Blackwell\nbeing better than I think you had said several billions of dollars in\nJanuary. It sounds like you're going to do more than that. But I think in\nrecent months also, you said that Blackwell crosses over Hopper in the\nApril quarter. So I guess I had 2 questions.\n\nFirst of all, is that still the right way to think about it, that Blackwell\nwill cross over Hopper in April? And then Colette, you kind of talked about\nBlackwell bringing down gross margin to the low 70s as it ramps. So I guess\nif April is the crossover, is that the worst of the pressure on gross\nmargin? So you're going to be kind of in the low 70s as soon as April. I'm\njust wondering if you can sort of shape that for us.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nColette, why don't you start?\n\nColette M. Kress\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nSure, let me first start with your question, Tim, thank you, regarding our\ngross margins. And we discussed that our gross margins as we are ramping\nBlackwell in the very beginning and the many different configurations, the\nmany different chips that we are bringing to market, we are going to focus\non making sure we have the best experience for our customers as they stand\nthat up.\n\nWe will start growing into our gross margins but we do believe those will\nbe in the low 70s in that first part of the ramp. So you're correct, as you\nlook at the quarters following after that, we will start increasing our\ngross margins, and we hope to get to the mid-70s quite quickly as part of\nthat round.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nHopper demand will continue through next year, surely the first several\nquarters of the next year. And meanwhile, we will ship more Blackwells next\nquarter than this, and we'll ship more Blackwells the quarter after that\nthan our first quarter. And so that kind of puts it in perspective. We are\nreally at the beginnings of 2 fundamental shifts in computing that is\nreally quite significant.\n\nThe first is moving from coding that runs on CPUs to machine learning that\ncreates neural networks that runs on GPUs. And that fundamental shift from\ncoding to machine learning is widespread at this point. There are no\ncompanies who are not going to do machine learning. And so machine learning\nis also what enables generative AI. And so on the one hand, the first thing\nthat's happening is $1 trillion worth of computing systems and data centers\naround the world is now being modernized for machine learning.\n\nOn the other hand, secondarily, I guess, is that on top of these systems\nare going to be -- we're going to be creating a new type of capability\ncalled AI. And when we say generative AI, we're essentially saying that\nthese data centers are really AI factories. They're generating something.\nJust like we generate electricity, we're now going to be generating AI. And\nif the number of customers is large, just as the number of consumers of\nelectricity is large, these generators are going to be running 24/7. And\ntoday, many AI services are running 24/7, just like an AI factory.\n\nAnd so we're going to see this new type of system come online, and I call\nit an AI factory because that's really as close to what it is. It's unlike\na data center of the past. And so these 2 fundamental trends are really\njust beginning. And so we expect this to happen, this growth, this\nmodernization and the creation of a new industry to go on for several\nyears.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America\nSecurities.\n\nVivek Arya\nBofA Securities, Research Division\n\nColette, just to clarify, do you think it's a fair assumption to think\nNVIDIA could recover to kind of mid-70s gross margin in the back half of\ncalendar '25? Just wanted to clarify that. And then Jensen, my main\nquestion, historically, when we have seen hardware deployment cycles, they\nhave inevitably included some digestion along the way. When do you think we\nget to that phase? Or is it just too premature to discuss that because\nyou're just at the start of Blackwell?\n\nSo how many quarters of shipments do you think is required to kind of\nsatisfy this first wave? Can you continue to grow this into calendar '26?\nJust how should we be prepared to see what we have seen historically,\nright, a period of digestion along the way of a long-term kind of secular\nhardware deployment?\n\nColette M. Kress\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nOkay. Vivek, thank you for the question. Let me clarify your question\nregarding gross margins. Could we reach the mid-70s in the second half of\nnext year? And yes, I think it is a reasonable assumption or goal for us to\ndo, but we'll just have to see how that mix of ramp goes. But yes, it is\ndefinitely possible.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nThe way to think through that, Vivek, is I believe that there will be no\ndigestion until we modernize $1 trillion with the data centers. Those -- if\nyou just look at the world's data centers, the vast majority of it is built\nfor a time when we wrote applications by hand and we ran them on CPUs. It's\njust not a sensible thing to do anymore. If you have -- if every company's\nCapEx, if they're ready to build data center tomorrow, they ought to build\nit for a future of machine learning and generative AI because they have\nplenty of old data centers.\n\nAnd so what's going to happen over the course of the next X number of\nyears, and let's assume that over the course of 4 years, the world's data\ncenters could be modernized as we grow into IT, as you know, IT continues\nto grow about 20%, 30% a year, let's say. And so -- but let's say by 2030,\nthe world's data centers for computing is, call it, a couple of trillion\ndollars. We have to grow into that. We have to modernize the data center\nfrom coding to machine learning. That's number one.\n\nThe second part of it is generative AI. And we're now producing a new type\nof capability the world's never known, a new market segment that the\nworld's never had. If you look at OpenAI, it didn't replace anything. It's\nsomething that's completely brand new. It's in a lot of ways as when the\niPhone came, it was completely brand new. It wasn't really replacing\nanything. And so we're going to see more and more companies like that. And\nthey're going to create and generate, out of their services, essentially\nintelligence.\n\nSome of it would be digital artist intelligence like Runway. Some of it\nwould be basic intelligence like OpenAI. Some of it would be legal\nintelligence like Harvey. Digital marketing intelligence like [ Writers ],\nso on and so forth. And the number of these companies, these -- what are\nthey called, AI-native companies, are just in hundreds. And almost every\nplatform shift, there was -- there were Internet companies, as you recall.\nThere were cloud-first companies. There were mobile-first companies. Now\nthey're AI natives.\n\nAnd so these companies are being created because people see that there's a\nplatform shift, and there's a brand-new opportunity to do something\ncompletely new. And so my sense is that we're going to continue to build\nout to modernize IT, modernize computing, number one; and then number two,\ncreate these AI factories that are going to be for a new industry for the\nproduction of artificial intelligence.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein\nResearch.\n\nStacy Aaron Rasgon\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\n\nColette, I had a clarification and a question for you. The clarification,\njust when you say low 70s gross margins, does -- is 73.5% count as low 70s\nor do you have something else in mind? And for my question, you're guiding\ntotal revenues, and so I mean, total data center revenues in the next\nquarter must be up \"several billion dollars.\" But it sounds like Blackwell\nnow should be up more than that.\n\nBut you also said Hopper was still strong, so like is Hopper down\nsequentially next quarter? And if it is, like why? Is it because of the\nsupply constraints? Is -- China has been pretty strong. Is China is kind of\nrolling off a bit into Q4? So any color you can give us on sort of the\nBlackwell ramp and the Blackwell versus Hopper behavior into Q4 would be\nreally helpful.\n\nColette M. Kress\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nSo first, starting on your first question there, Stacy, regarding our gross\nmargin and define low. Low, of course, is below the mids and let's say, we\nmight be at 71%, maybe about 72%, 72.5%. We're going to be in that range.\nWe could be higher than that as well. We're just going to have to see how\nit comes through. We do want to make sure that we are ramping and\ncontinuing that improvement, the improvement in terms of our yields, the\nimprovement in terms of the product as we go through the rest of the year.\nSo we'll get up to the mid-70s by that point.\n\nThe second statement was a question regarding our Hopper and what is our\nHopper doing? We have seen substantial growth for H200 not only in terms of\norders but the quickness in terms of those that are standing that out. It\nis an amazing product and it's the fastest growing and ramping that we've\nseen. We will continue to be selling Hopper in this quarter, in Q4 for\nsure. That is across the board in terms of all of our different\nconfigurations, and our configurations include what we may do in terms of\nChina.\n\nBut keep that in mind that folks are also, at the same time, looking to\nbuild out their Blackwell. So we've got a little bit of both happening in\nQ4. But yes, is it possible for Hopper to grow between Q3 and Q4? It's\npossible but we'll just have to see.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley.\n\nJoseph Lawrence Moore\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\n\nGreat. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in\nthe inference market. You've talked about Strawberry and some of the\nramifications of longer scaling inference projects. But you've also talked\nabout the possibility that as some of these Hopper clusters age that you\ncould use some of the Hopper latent chips for inference. So I guess do you\nexpect inference to outgrow training in the next kind of 12 months time\nframe? And just generally, your thoughts there.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nOur hopes and dreams is that someday, the world does a ton of inference.\nAnd that's when AI has really exceeded is when every single company is\ndoing inference inside their companies for the marketing department and\nforecasting department and supply chain group and their legal department\nand engineering, of course, and coding of course. And so we hope that every\ncompany is doing inference 24/7.\n\nAnd that there will be a whole bunch of AI native startups, thousands of AI\nnative startups that are generating tokens and generating AI. And every\naspect of your computer experience from using Outlook to PowerPointing or\nwhen you're sitting there with Excel, you're constantly generating tokens.\nAnd every time you read a PDF, open a PDF, it generated a whole bunch of\ntokens. One of my favorite applications is NotebookLM, this Google\napplication that came out. I use the living daylights out of it just\nbecause it's fun.\n\nAnd I put every PDF, every archived paper into it just to listen to it as\nwell as scanning through it. And so I think that's the goal is to train\nthese models so that people use it. And there's now a whole new era of AI,\nif you will, a whole new genre of AI called physical AI, just those large\nlanguage models understand the human language and how the thinking process,\nif you will. Physical AI understands the physical world. And it understands\nthe meaning of the structure and understands what's sensible and what's not\nand what could happen and what won't.\n\nAnd not only does it understand but it can predict, roll out a short\nfuture. That capability is incredibly valuable for industrial AI and\nrobotics. And so that's fired up so many AI native companies and robotics\ncompanies and physical AI companies that you're probably hearing about. And\nit's really the reason why we built Omniverse. Omniverse is so that we can\nenable these AIs to be created and learn in Omniverse and learn from\nsynthetic data generation and reinforcement, learning physics feedback\ninstead of just a human feedback, it's now physics feedback. To have these\ncapabilities, Omniverse was created so that we can enable physical AI.\n\nAnd so that -- the goal is to generate tokens. The goal is to inference,\nand we're starting to see that growth happening. So I'm super excited about\nthat. Now let me just say one more thing. Inference is super hard. And the\nreason why inference is super hard is because you need the accuracy to be\nhigh on the one hand. You need the throughput to be high so that the cost\ncould be as low as possible, but you also need the latency to be low.\n\nAnd computers that are high-throughput as well as low latency is incredibly\nhard to build. And these applications have long context lengths because\nthey want to understand. They want to be able to inference within\nunderstanding the context of what they're being asked to do. And so the\ncontext length is growing larger and larger. On the other hand, the models\nare getting larger. They're multimodality.\n\nJust the number of dimensions that inference is innovating is incredible.\nAnd this innovation rate is what makes NVIDIA's architecture so great\nbecause we -- our ecosystem is fantastic. Everybody knows that if they\ninnovate on top of CUDA and top of NVIDIA's architecture, they can innovate\nmore quickly and they know that everything should work. And if something\nwere to happen, it's probably likely their code and not ours.\n\nAnd so that ability to innovate in every single direction at the same time,\nhaving a large installed base so that whatever you create could land on an\nNVIDIA computer and be deployed broadly all around the world in every\nsingle data center all the way out to the edge into robotic systems, that\ncapability is really quite phenomenal.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo.\n\nAaron Christopher Rakers\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\n\nI wanted to ask you, as we kind of focus on the Blackwell cycle and think\nabout the Data Center business. When I look at the results this last\nquarter, Colette, you mentioned that obviously, the networking business was\ndown about 15% sequentially. But then your comments were that you were\nseeing very strong demand. You mentioned also that you had multiple cloud\nCSP design wins for these large-scale clusters. So I'm curious if you could\nunpack what's going on in the Networking business and where maybe you've\nseen some constraints and just your confidence in the pace of Spectrum-X\nprogressing to that multiple billions of dollars that you previously had\ntalked about.\n\nColette M. Kress\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nLet's first start with the networking. The growth year-over-year is\ntremendous. And our focus since the beginning of our acquisition of\nMellanox has really been about building together the work that we do in\nterms of in the data center. The networking is such a critical part of\nthat. Our ability to sell our networking with many of our systems that we\nare doing in data center is continuing to grow and do quite well.\n\nSo this quarter is just a slight dip down and we're going to be right back\nup in terms of growing. We're getting ready for Blackwell and more and more\nsystems that will be using not only our existing networking but also the\nnetworking that is going to be incorporated in a lot of these large systems\nwe are providing them to.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Atif Malik of Citi.\n\nAtif Malik\nCitigroup Inc., Research Division\n\nI have 2 quick ones for Colette. Colette, on the last earnings call, you\nmentioned that sovereign demand is in low double-digit billions. Can you\nprovide an update on that? And then can you explain the supply-constrained\nsituation in gaming? Is that because you're shifting your supply towards\ndata center?\n\nColette M. Kress\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nSo first starting in terms of sovereign AI, such an important part of\ngrowth, something that is really surfaced with the onset of generative AI\nand building models in the individual countries around the world. And we\nsee a lot of them, and we talked about a lot of them on the call today and\nthe work that they are doing. So our sovereign AI and our pipeline going\nforward is still absolutely intact as those are working to build these\nfoundational models in their own language, in their own culture, and\nworking in terms of the enterprises within those countries.\n\nAnd I think you'll continue to see this be growth opportunities that you\nmay see with our regional clouds that are being stood up and/or those that\nare focusing in terms of AI factories for many parts of the sovereign AI.\nThis is areas where this is growing not only in terms of in Europe, but\nyou're also seeing this in terms of growth in terms of in the Asia Pac as\nwell.\n\nLet me flip to your second question that you asked regarding Gaming. So our\nGaming right now from a supply, we're busy trying to make sure that we can\nramp all of our different products. And in this case, our gaming supply,\ngiven what we saw selling through was moving quite fast. Now the challenge\nthat we have is how fast could we get that supply getting ready into the\nmarket for this quarter. Not to worry, I think we'll be back on track with\nmore supply as we turn the corner into the new calendar year. We're just\ngoing to be tight for this quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes of Melius Research.\n\nBenjamin Alexander Reitzes\nMelius Research LLC\n\nI wanted to ask Colette and Jensen with regard to sequential growth. So\nvery strong sequential growth this quarter, and you're guiding to about 7%.\nDo your comments on Blackwell imply that we reaccelerate from there as you\nget more supply? Just in the first half, it would seem that there would be\nsome catch-ups. So I was wondering how prescriptive you could be there.\n\nAnd then, Jensen, just overall with the change in administration that's\ngoing to take place here in the U.S. and the China situation, have you\ngotten any sense or any conversations about tariffs or anything with regard\nto your China business? Any sense of what may or may not go on? It's\nprobably too early but wondering if you had any thoughts there.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nWe guide 1 quarter at a time.\n\nColette M. Kress\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nWe are working right now on the quarter that we're in and building what we\nneed to ship in terms of Blackwell. We have every supplier on the planet\nworking seamlessly with us to do that. And once we get to next quarter,\nwe'll help you understand in terms of that ramp that we'll see to the next\nquarter going after that.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nWhatever the new administration decides, we will, of course, support the\nadministration. And that's our -- the highest mandate. And then after that,\ndo the best we can and just as we always do. And so we have to\nsimultaneously and we will comply with any regulation that comes along\nfully and support our customers to the best of our abilities and to compete\nin the marketplace. We'll do all of these 3 things simultaneously.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu of New Street\nResearch.\n\nPierre C. Ferragu\nNew Street Research LLP\n\nJensen, you mentioned in your comments, you have the pretraining, the\nactual language models and you have reinforcement learning that becomes\nmore and more important in training and inference as well and then you have\ninference itself. And I was wondering if you have a sense like a high-level\ntypical sense of out of an overall AI ecosystem, like maybe one of your\nclients or one of the large models that are out there. Today, how much of\nthe compute goes into each of these buckets? How much for the pretraining?\nHow much for the reinforcement? And how much into inference today? Do you\nhave any sense for how it's splitting and where the growth is the most\nimportant as well?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nWell, today, it's vastly in pretraining a foundation model because, as you\nknow, post-training, the new technologies are just coming online. And\nwhatever you could do in pretraining and post-training, you would try to do\nso that the inference cost could be as low as possible for everyone.\nHowever, there are only so many things that you could do a priority. And so\nyou'll always have to do on-the-spot thinking and in context thinking and a\nreflection.\n\nAnd so I think that the fact that all 3 are scaling is actually very\nsensible based on where we are. And in the area foundation model, now we\nhave multimodality foundation models and the amount of petabytes video that\nthese foundation models are going to be trained on, it's incredible. And so\nmy expectation is that for the foreseeable future, we're going to be\nscaling pretraining, post-training as well as inference time scaling and\nwhich is the reason why I think we're going to need more and more compute.\nAnd we're going to have to drive as hard as we can to keep increasing the\nperformance by X factors out of time so that we can continue to drive down\nthe cost and continue to increase the revenues and get the AI revolution\ngoing.\n\nOperator\n\nI'll now turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nThank you. The tremendous growth in our business is being fueled by 2\nfundamental trends that are driving global adoption of NVIDIA computing.\nFirst, the computing stack is undergoing a reinvention, a platform shift\nfrom coding to machine learning, from executing code on CPUs to processing\nneural networks on GPUs. The $1 trillion installed base of traditional data\ncenter infrastructure is being rebuilt for Software 2.0, which applies\nmachine learning to produce AI.\n\nSecond, the age of AI is in full steam. Generative AI is not just a new\nsoftware capability but a new industry with AI factories manufacturing\ndigital intelligence, a new industrial revolution that can create a multi-\ntrillion-dollar AI industry. Demand for Hopper and anticipation for\nBlackwell, which is now in full production, are incredible for several\nreasons. There are more foundation model makers now than there were a year\nago.\n\nThe computing scale of pretraining and post-training continues to grow\nexponentially. There are more AI native startups than ever and the number\nof successful inference services is rising. And with the introduction of\nChatGPT o1, OpenAI o1, a new scaling law called test-time scaling has\nemerged. All of these consume a great deal of computing. AI is transforming\nevery industry, company and country. Enterprises are adopting agentic AI to\nrevolutionize workflows. Over time, AI coworkers will assist employees in\nperforming their jobs faster and better.\n\nInvestments in industrial robotics are surging due to breakthroughs in\nphysical AI, driving new training infrastructure demand as researchers\ntrain world foundation models on petabytes of video and Omniverse\nsynthetically generated data. The age of robotics is coming. Countries\nacross the world recognize the fundamental AI trends we are seeing and have\nawakened to the importance of developing their national AI infrastructure.\n\nThe age of AI is upon us and it's large and diverse. NVIDIA's expertise,\nscale, and ability to deliver full stack and full infrastructure lets us\nserve the entire multi-trillion-dollar AI and robotics opportunities ahead\nfrom every hyperscale cloud, enterprise private cloud to sovereign regional\nAI clouds, on-prem to industrial edge and robotics. Thanks for joining us\ntoday, and catch up next time.\n\nOperatorThis concludes today's conference call.

      "text": "Executive VP & CFO Thank you, Stewart. Q3 was another record quarter. We continue to deliver incredible growth. Revenue of $35.1 billion was up 17% sequentially and up 94% year-on-year and well above our outlook of $32.5 billion. All market platforms posted strong sequential and year-over-year growth, fueled by the adoption of NVIDIA accelerated computing and AI. Starting with Data Center. Another record was achieved in Data Center. Revenue of $30.8 billion, up 17% sequential and up 112% year-on-year. NVIDIA Hopper demand is exceptional, and sequentially, NVIDIA H200 sales increased significantly to double-digit billions, the fastest prod ramp in our company's history. The H200 delivers up to 2x faster inference performance and up to 50% improved TCO. Cloud service providers were approximately half of our Data Center sales with revenue increasing more than 2x year-on-year. CSPs deployed NVIDIA H200 infrastructure and high-speed networking with installations scaling to tens of thousands of GPUs to grow their business and serve rapidly rising demand for AI training and inference workloads. NVIDIA H200-powered cloud instances are now available from AWS, CoreWeave and Microsoft Azure with Google Cloud and OCI coming soon. Alongside significant growth from our large CSPs, NVIDIA GPU regional cloud revenue jumped 2x year-on-year as North America, India, and Asia Pacific regions ramped NVIDIA Cloud instances and sovereign cloud build-outs. Consumer Internet revenue more than doubled year-on-year as companies scaled their NVIDIA Hopper infrastructure to support next-generation AI models, training, multimodal and agentic AI, deep learning recommender engines, and generative AI inference and content creation workloads. NVIDIA's Ampere and Hopper infrastructures are fueling inference revenue growth for customers. NVIDIA is the largest inference platform in the world. Our large installed base and rich software ecosystem encourage developers to optimize for NVIDIA and deliver continued performance and TCO improvements. Rapid advancements in NVIDIA software algorithms boosted Hopper inference throughput by an incredible 5x in 1 year and cut time to first token by 5x. Our upcoming release of NVIDIA NIM will boost Hopper inference performance by an additional 2.4x. Continuous performance optimizations are a hallmark of NVIDIA and drive increasingly economic returns for the entire NVIDIA installed base. Blackwell is in full production after a successfully executed mask change. We shipped 13,000 GPU samples to customers in the third quarter, including one of the first Blackwell DGX engineering samples to OpenAI. Blackwell is a full stack, full infrastructure, AI data center scale system with customizable configurations needed to address a diverse and growing AI market from x86 to ARM, training to inferencing GPUs, InfiniBand to Ethernet switches, and NVLink and from liquid cooled to air cooled, every customer is racing to be the first to market. Blackwell is now in the hands of all of our major partners, and they are working to bring up their data centers. We are integrating Blackwell systems into the diverse data center configurations of our customers. Blackwell demand is staggering, and we are racing to scale supply to meet the incredible demand customers are placing on us. Customers are gearing up to deploy Blackwell at scale. Oracle announced the world's first Zettascale AI cloud computing clusters that can scale to over 131,000 Blackwell GPUs to help enterprises train and deploy some of the most demanding next- generation AI models. Yesterday, Microsoft announced they will be the first CSP to offer, in private preview, Blackwell-based cloud instances powered by NVIDIA GB200 and Quantum InfiniBand. Last week, Blackwell made its debut on the most recent round of MLPerf training results, sweeping the per GPU benchmarks and delivering a 2.2x leap in performance over Hopper. The results also demonstrate our relentless pursuit to drive down the cost of compute. The 64 Blackwell GPUs are required to run the GPT-3 benchmark compared to 256 H100s or a 4x reduction in cost. NVIDIA Blackwell architecture with NVLink Switch enables up to 30x faster inference performance and a new level of inference scaling, throughput and response time that is excellent for running new reasoning inference applications like OpenAI's o1 model. With every new platform shift, a wave of start-ups is created. Hundreds of AI-native companies are already delivering AI services with great success. Through Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI are the headliners. Anthropic, Perplexity, Mistral, Adobe Firefly, Runway, Midjourney, Lightricks, Harvey, Codeium, Cursor and the Bridge are seeing great success while thousands of AI-native start-ups are building new services. The next wave of AI are enterprise AI and industrial AI. Enterprise AI is in full throttle. NVIDIA AI Enterprise, which includes NVIDIA NeMo and NIM microservices is an operating platform of agentic AI. Industry leaders are using NVIDIA AI to build Copilots and agents. Working with NVIDIA, Cadence, Cloudera, Cohesity, NetApp, Nutanix, Salesforce, SAP and ServiceNow are racing to accelerate development of these applications with the potential for billions of agents to be deployed in the coming years. Consulting leaders like Accenture and Deloitte are taking NVIDIA AI to the world's enterprises. Accenture launched a new business group with 30,000 professionals trained on NVIDIA AI technology to help facilitate this global build-out. Additionally, Accenture with over 770,000 employees, is leveraging NVIDIA- powered agentic AI applications internally, including 1 case that cuts manual steps in marketing campaigns by 25% to 35%. Nearly 1,000 companies are using NVIDIA NIM, and the speed of its uptake is evident in NVIDIA AI enterprise monetization. We expect NVIDIA AI enterprise full year revenue to increase over 2x from last year and our pipeline continues to build. Overall, our software, service and support revenue is annualizing at $1.5 billion, and we expect to exit this year annualizing at over $2 billion. Industrial AI and robotics are accelerating. This is triggered by breakthroughs in physical AI, foundation models that understand the physical world, like NVIDIA NeMo for enterprise AI agents. We built NVIDIA Omniverse for developers to build, train, and operate industrial AI and robotics. Some of the largest industrial manufacturers in the world are adopting NVIDIA Omniverse to accelerate their businesses, automate their workflows, and to achieve new levels of operating efficiency. Foxconn, the world's largest electronics manufacturer, is using digital twins and industrial AI built on NVIDIA Omniverse to speed the bring-up of its Blackwell factories and drive new levels of efficiency. In its Mexico facility alone, Foxconn expects to reduce -- a reduction of over 30% in annual kilowatt hour usage. From a geographic perspective, our data center revenue in China grew sequentially due to shipments of export-compliant Hopper products to industries. As a percentage of total data center revenue, it remained well below levels prior to the onset of export controls. We expect the market in China to remain very competitive going forward. We will continue to comply with export controls while serving our customers. Our sovereign AI initiatives continue to gather momentum as countries embrace NVIDIA accelerated computing for a new industrial revolution powered by AI. India's leading CSPs include product communications and Yotta Data Services are building AI factories for tens of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs. By year-end, they will have boosted NVIDIA GPU deployments in the country by nearly 10x. Infosys, TSE (sic) [ TCS ], Wipro are adopting NVIDIA AI enterprise and upskilling nearly 0.5 million developers and consultants to help clients build and run AI agents on our platform. In Japan, SoftBank is building the nation's most powerful AI supercomputer with NVIDIA DGX Blackwell and Quantum InfiniBand. SoftBank is also partnering with NVIDIA to transform the telecommunications network into a distributed AI network with NVIDIA AI Aerial and AI-RAN platform that can process both 5G RAN on AI on CUDA. We are launching the same in the U.S. with T-Mobile. Leaders across Japan, including Fujitsu, NEC and NTT are adopting NVIDIA AI Enterprise and major consulting companies, including EY Strategy and Consulting will help bring NVIDIA AI technology to Japan's industries. Networking revenue increased 20% year-on-year. Areas of sequential revenue growth include InfiniBand and Ethernet switches, SmartNICs and BlueField DPUs. Though networking revenue was sequentially down, networking demand is strong and growing, and we anticipate sequential growth in Q4. CSPs and supercomputing centers are using and adopting the NVIDIA InfiniBand platform to power new H200 clusters. NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet for AI revenue increased over 3x year-on-year. And our pipeline continues to build with multiple CSPs and consumer Internet companies planning large cluster deployments. Traditional Ethernet was not designed for AI. NVIDIA Spectrum-X uniquely leverages technology previously exclusive to InfiniBand to enable customers to achieve massive scale of their GPU compute. Utilizing Spectrum-X, xAI's Colossus 100,000 Hopper supercomputer experienced 0 application latency degradation and maintained 95% data throughput versus 60% for traditional Ethernet. Now moving to Gaming and AI PCs. Gaming revenue of $3.3 billion increased 14% sequentially and 15% year-on-year. Q3 was a great quarter for Gaming with notebook, console, and desktop revenue all growing sequentially and year-on-year. RTX end demand was fueled by strong back-to-school sales as consumers continue to choose GeForce RTX GPUs and devices to power gaming, creative and AI applications. Channel inventory remains healthy and we are gearing up for the holiday season. We began shipping new GeForce RTX AI PC with up to 321 AI TOPS from ASUS and MSI with Microsoft's Copilot+ capabilities anticipated in Q4. These machines harness the power of RTX ray tracing and AI technologies to supercharge gaming, photo, and video editing, image generation and coding. This past quarter, we celebrated the 25th anniversary of the GeForce 256, the world's first GPU. The transforming executing graphics to igniting the AI revolution. NVIDIA's GPUs have been the driving force behind some of the most consequential technologies of our time. Moving to ProViz. Revenue of $486 million was up 7% sequentially and 17% year-on-year. NVIDIA RTX workstations continue to be the preferred choice to power professional graphics, design, and engineering-related workloads. Additionally, AI is emerging as a powerful demand driver, including autonomous vehicle simulation, generative AI model prototyping for productivity-related use cases and generative AI content creation in media and entertainment. Moving to Automotive. Revenue was a record $449 million, up 30% sequentially and up 72% year-on-year. Strong growth was driven by self- driving brands of NVIDIA Orin and robust end market demand for NAVs. Volvo Cars is rolling out its fully electric SUV built on NVIDIA Orin and DriveOS. Okay. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin was 74.6% and non- GAAP gross margin was 75%, down sequentially, primarily driven by a mix shift of the H100 systems to more complex and higher-cost systems within Data Center. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 9% due to higher compute, infrastructure and engineering development costs for new product introductions. In Q3, we returned $11.2 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. Well, let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, which incorporates continued demand for Hopper architecture and the initial ramp of our Blackwell products. While demand greatly exceed supply, we are on track to exceed our previous Blackwell revenue estimate of several billion dollars as our visibility into supply continues to increase. On Gaming, although sell-through was strong in Q3, we expect fourth quarter revenue to decline sequentially due to supply constraints. GAAP and non- GAAP gross margins are expected to be 73% and 73.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. Blackwell is a customizable AI infrastructure with 7 different types of NVIDIA-built chips, multiple networking options and for air and liquid-cooled data centers. Our current focus is on ramping to strong demand, increasing system availability, and providing the optimal mix of configurations to our customer. As Blackwell ramps, we expect gross margins to moderate to the low 70s. When fully ramped, we expect Blackwell margins to be in the mid-70s. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. We are a data center-scale AI infrastructure company. Our investments include building data centers for development of our hardware and software stacks and to support new introductions. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $400 million, excluding gains and losses from nonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 16.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the UBS Global Technology and AI Conference on December 3 in Scottsdale. Please join us at CES in Las Vegas, where Jensen will deliver a keynote on January 6. And we will host a Q&A session for financial analysts the next day on January 7. Our earnings call to discuss results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 is scheduled for February 26, 2025. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, can you poll for questions, please? Question and Answer",

      "text": "Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division I guess, Jensen, a question for you on the debate around whether scaling for large language models have stalled. Obviously, we're very early here, but would love to hear your thoughts on this front. How are you helping your customers as they work through these issues? And then obviously, part of the context here is we're discussing clusters that have yet to benefit from Blackwell. So is this driving even greater demand for Blackwell? Jensen Huang Foundation model pretraining scaling is intact and it's continuing. As you know, this is an empirical law, not a fundamental physical law. But the evidence is that it continues to scale. What we're learning, however, is that it's not enough, that we've now discovered 2 other ways to scale. One is post-training scaling. Of course, the first generation of post-training was reinforcement learning human feedback, but now we have reinforcement learning AI feedback and all forms of synthetic data generated data that assists in post-training scaling. And one of the biggest events and one of the most exciting developments is Strawberry, ChatGPT o1, OpenAI's o1, which does inference time scaling, what's called test time scaling. The longer it thinks, the better and higher-quality answer it produces. And it considers approaches like chain of thought and multi-path planning and all kinds of techniques necessary to reflect and so on and so forth. And it's -- intuitively, it's a little bit like us doing thinking in our head before we answer your question. And so we now have 3 ways of scaling and we're seeing all 3 ways of scaling. And as a result of that, the demand for our infrastructure is really great. You see now that at the tail end of the last generation of foundation models were at about 100,000 Hoppers. The next generation starts at 100,000 Blackwells. And so that kind of gives you a sense of where the industry is moving with respect to pretraining scaling, post-training scaling, and then now very importantly, inference time scaling. And so the demand is really great for all of those reasons. But remember, simultaneously, we're seeing inference really starting to scale up for our company. We are the largest inference platform in the world today because our installed base is so large. And everything that was trained on Amperes and Hoppers inference incredibly on Amperes and Hoppers. And as we move to Blackwells for training foundation models, it leads behind it a large installed base of extraordinary infrastructure for inference. And so we're seeing inference demand go up. We're seeing inference time scaling go up. We see the number of AI-native companies continue to grow. And of course, we're starting to see enterprise adoption of agentic AI really is the latest rage. And so we're seeing a lot of demand coming from a lot of different places.",

      "text": "Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division Jensen, you executed the mass change earlier this year. There were some reports over the weekend about some heating issues. On the back of this, we've had investors ask about your ability to execute to the road map you presented at GTC this year with Ultra coming out next year and the transition to Rubin in '26. Can you sort of speak to that? And some investors are questioning that, so if you can sort of speak to your ability to execute on time, that would be super helpful. And then a quick part B. On supply constraints, is it a multitude of componentry that's causing this or is it specifically CoWoS, HBM? Is it supply constraints? Are the supply constraints getting better? Are they worsening? Any sort of color on that would be super helpful as well. Jensen Huang Yes, thanks. So let's see. Back to the first question. Blackwell production is in full steam. In fact, as Colette mentioned earlier, we will deliver this quarter more Blackwells than we had previously estimated. And so the supply chain team is doing an incredible job working with our supply partners to increase Blackwell, and we're going to continue to work hard to increase Blackwell through next year. It is the case that demand exceeds our supply. And that's expected as we're in the beginnings of this generative AI revolution as we all know. And we're at the beginning of a new generation of foundation models that are able to do reasoning and able to do long thinking. And of course, one of the really exciting areas is physical AI, AI that now understands the structure of the physical world. And so Blackwell demand is very strong. Our execution is going well. And there's obviously a lot of engineering that we're doing across the world. You see now systems that are being stood up by Dell and CoreWeave. I think you saw systems from Oracle stood up. You have systems from Microsoft, and they're about to preview their Grace Blackwell systems. You have systems that are at Google. And so all of these CSPs are racing to be first. The engineering that we do with them is, as you know, rather complicated. And the reason for that is because although we build full stack and full infrastructure, we disaggregate all of this AI supercomputer and we integrate it into all of the custom data centers and architectures around the world. That integration process, it's something we've done several generations now. We're very good at it but still there's still a lot of engineering that happens at this point. But as you see from all of the systems that are being stood up, Blackwell is in great shape. And as we mentioned earlier, the supply and what we're planning to ship this quarter is greater than our previous estimates. With respect to the supply chain, there are 7 different chips, 7 custom chips that we built in order for us to deliver the Blackwell systems. The Blackwell systems go in air-cooled or liquid-cooled, NVLink 8 or NVLink 72 or NVLink 8, NVLink 36, NVLink 72. We have x86 or Grace. And the integration of all of those systems into the world's data centers is nothing short of a miracle. And so the component supply chain necessary to ramp at this scale, you have to go back and take a look at how much Blackwell we shipped last quarter, which was 0. And in terms of how much Blackwell total systems will ship this quarter, which is measured in billions, the ramp is incredible. And so almost every company in the world seems to be involved in our supply chain. And we've got great partners, everybody from, of course, TSMC and Amphenol, the connector company, incredible company. Vertiv and SK Hynix and Micron, [ Spill ], Amkor, KYEC, and there's Foxconn and the factories that they've built and Quanta and Wiwynn and, gosh, Dell and HP, and Super Micro, Lenovo and the number of companies is just really quite incredible, Quanta. And I'm sure I've missed partners that are involved in the ramping of Blackwell, which I really appreciate. And so anyways, I think we're in great shape with respect to the Blackwell ramp at this point. And then lastly, your question about our execution of our road map. We're on an annual road map and we're expecting to continue to execute on our annual road map. And by doing so, we increased the performance, of course, of our platform. But it's also really important to realize that when we're able to increase performance and do so at X factors at a time, we're reducing the cost of training. We're reducing the cost of inferencing. We're reducing the cost of AI so that it could be much more accessible. But the other factor that's very important to note is that when there's a data center of some fixed size and the data center always is of some fixed size. It could be, of course, tens of megawatts in the past, and now it's -- most data centers are now 100 megawatts to several hundred megawatts, and we're planning on gigawatt data centers, it doesn't really matter how large the data centers are. The power is limited. And when you're in the power- limited data center, the best -- the highest performance per watt translates directly into the highest revenues for our partners. And so on the one hand, our annual road map reduces cost. But on the other hand, because our perf per watt is so good compared to anything out there, we generate for our customers the greatest possible revenues. And so that annual rhythm is really important to us, and we have every intentions of continuing to do that. And everything is on track as far as I know.",

      "text": "UBS Investment Bank, Research Division I'm wondering if you can talk about the trajectory of how Blackwell is going to ramp this year. I know Jensen, you did just talk about Blackwell being better than I think you had said several billions of dollars in January. It sounds like you're going to do more than that. But I think in recent months also, you said that Blackwell crosses over Hopper in the April quarter. So I guess I had 2 questions. First of all, is that still the right way to think about it, that Blackwell will cross over Hopper in April? And then Colette, you kind of talked about Blackwell bringing down gross margin to the low 70s as it ramps. So I guess if April is the crossover, is that the worst of the pressure on gross margin? So you're going to be kind of in the low 70s as soon as April. I'm just wondering if you can sort of shape that for us. Jensen Huang Colette, why don't you start?",

      "text": "Executive VP & CFO Sure, let me first start with your question, Tim, thank you, regarding our gross margins. And we discussed that our gross margins as we are ramping Blackwell in the very beginning and the many different configurations, the many different chips that we are bringing to market, we are going to focus on making sure we have the best experience for our customers as they stand that up. We will start growing into our gross margins but we do believe those will be in the low 70s in that first part of the ramp. So you're correct, as you look at the quarters following after that, we will start increasing our gross margins, and we hope to get to the mid-70s quite quickly as part of that round. Jensen Huang Hopper demand will continue through next year, surely the first several quarters of the next year. And meanwhile, we will ship more Blackwells next quarter than this, and we'll ship more Blackwells the quarter after that than our first quarter. And so that kind of puts it in perspective. We are really at the beginnings of 2 fundamental shifts in computing that is really quite significant. The first is moving from coding that runs on CPUs to machine learning that creates neural networks that runs on GPUs. And that fundamental shift from coding to machine learning is widespread at this point. There are no companies who are not going to do machine learning. And so machine learning is also what enables generative AI. And so on the one hand, the first thing that's happening is $1 trillion worth of computing systems and data centers around the world is now being modernized for machine learning. On the other hand, secondarily, I guess, is that on top of these systems are going to be -- we're going to be creating a new type of capability called AI. And when we say generative AI, we're essentially saying that these data centers are really AI factories. They're generating something. Just like we generate electricity, we're now going to be generating AI. And if the number of customers is large, just as the number of consumers of electricity is large, these generators are going to be running 24/7. And today, many AI services are running 24/7, just like an AI factory. And so we're going to see this new type of system come online, and I call it an AI factory because that's really as close to what it is. It's unlike a data center of the past. And so these 2 fundamental trends are really just beginning. And so we expect this to happen, this growth, this modernization and the creation of a new industry to go on for several years.",

Just wanted to clarify that. And then Jensen, my main question, historically, when we have seen hardware deployment cycles, they have inevitably included some digestion along the way. When do you think we get to that phase? Or is it just too premature to discuss that because you're just at the start of Blackwell? So how many quarters of shipments do you think is required to kind of satisfy this first wave? Can you continue to grow this into calendar '26? Just how should we be prepared to see what we have seen historically, right, a period of digestion along the way of a long-term kind of secular hardware deployment?",

And yes, I think it is a reasonable assumption or goal for us to do, but we'll just have to see how that mix of ramp goes. But yes, it is definitely possible. Jensen Huang The way to think through that, Vivek, is I believe that there will be no digestion until we modernize $1 trillion with the data centers. Those -- if you just look at the world's data centers, the vast majority of it is built for a time when we wrote applications by hand and we ran them on CPUs. It's just not a sensible thing to do anymore. If you have -- if every company's CapEx, if they're ready to build data center tomorrow, they ought to build it for a future of machine learning and generative AI because they have plenty of old data centers. And so what's going to happen over the course of the next X number of years, and let's assume that over the course of 4 years, the world's data centers could be modernized as we grow into IT, as you know, IT continues to grow about 20%, 30% a year, let's say. And so -- but let's say by 2030, the world's data centers for computing is, call it, a couple of trillion dollars. We have to grow into that. We have to modernize the data center from coding to machine learning. That's number one. The second part of it is generative AI. And we're now producing a new type of capability the world's never known, a new market segment that the world's never had. If you look at OpenAI, it didn't replace anything. It's something that's completely brand new. It's in a lot of ways as when the iPhone came, it was completely brand new. It wasn't really replacing anything. And so we're going to see more and more companies like that. And they're going to create and generate, out of their services, essentially intelligence. Some of it would be digital artist intelligence like Runway. Some of it would be basic intelligence like OpenAI. Some of it would be legal intelligence like Harvey. Digital marketing intelligence like [ Writers ], so on and so forth. And the number of these companies, these -- what are they called, AI-native companies, are just in hundreds. And almost every platform shift, there was -- there were Internet companies, as you recall. There were cloud-first companies. There were mobile-first companies. Now they're AI natives. And so these companies are being created because people see that there's a platform shift, and there's a brand-new opportunity to do something completely new. And so my sense is that we're going to continue to build out to modernize IT, modernize computing, number one; and then number two, create these AI factories that are going to be for a new industry for the production of artificial intelligence.",

And for my question, you're guiding total revenues, and so I mean, total data center revenues in the next quarter must be up \"several billion dollars.\" But it sounds like Blackwell now should be up more than that. But you also said Hopper was still strong, so like is Hopper down sequentially next quarter? And if it is, like why? Is it because of the supply constraints? Is -- China has been pretty strong.

Low, of course, is below the mids and let's say, we might be at 71%, maybe about 72%, 72.5%. We're going to be in that range. We could be higher than that as well. We're just going to have to see how it comes through. We do want to make sure that we are ramping and continuing that improvement, the improvement in terms of our yields, the improvement in terms of the product as we go through the rest of the year. So we'll get up to the mid-70s by that point. The second statement was a question regarding our Hopper and what is our Hopper doing? We have seen substantial growth for H200 not only in terms of orders but the quickness in terms of those that are standing that out. It is an amazing product and it's the fastest growing and ramping that we've seen. We will continue to be selling Hopper in this quarter, in Q4 for sure. That is across the board in terms of all of our different configurations, and our configurations include what we may do in terms of China. But keep that in mind that folks are also, at the same time, looking to build out their Blackwell. So we've got a little bit of both happening in Q4.

      "text": "Morgan Stanley, Research Division Great. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the inference market. You've talked about Strawberry and some of the ramifications of longer scaling inference projects. But you've also talked about the possibility that as some of these Hopper clusters age that you could use some of the Hopper latent chips for inference. So I guess do you expect inference to outgrow training in the next kind of 12 months time frame? And just generally, your thoughts there. Jensen Huang Our hopes and dreams is that someday, the world does a ton of inference. And that's when AI has really exceeded is when every single company is doing inference inside their companies for the marketing department and forecasting department and supply chain group and their legal department and engineering, of course, and coding of course. And so we hope that every company is doing inference 24/7. And that there will be a whole bunch of AI native startups, thousands of AI native startups that are generating tokens and generating AI. And every aspect of your computer experience from using Outlook to PowerPointing or when you're sitting there with Excel, you're constantly generating tokens. And every time you read a PDF, open a PDF, it generated a whole bunch of tokens. One of my favorite applications is NotebookLM, this Google application that came out. I use the living daylights out of it just because it's fun. And I put every PDF, every archived paper into it just to listen to it as well as scanning through it. And so I think that's the goal is to train these models so that people use it. And there's now a whole new era of AI, if you will, a whole new genre of AI called physical AI, just those large language models understand the human language and how the thinking process, if you will. Physical AI understands the physical world. And it understands the meaning of the structure and understands what's sensible and what's not and what could happen and what won't. And not only does it understand but it can predict, roll out a short future. That capability is incredibly valuable for industrial AI and robotics. And so that's fired up so many AI native companies and robotics companies and physical AI companies that you're probably hearing about. And it's really the reason why we built Omniverse. Omniverse is so that we can enable these AIs to be created and learn in Omniverse and learn from synthetic data generation and reinforcement, learning physics feedback instead of just a human feedback, it's now physics feedback. To have these capabilities, Omniverse was created so that we can enable physical AI. And so that -- the goal is to generate tokens. The goal is to inference, and we're starting to see that growth happening. So I'm super excited about that. Now let me just say one more thing. Inference is super hard. And the reason why inference is super hard is because you need the accuracy to be high on the one hand. You need the throughput to be high so that the cost could be as low as possible, but you also need the latency to be low. And computers that are high-throughput as well as low latency is incredibly hard to build. And these applications have long context lengths because they want to understand. They want to be able to inference within understanding the context of what they're being asked to do. And so the context length is growing larger and larger. On the other hand, the models are getting larger. They're multimodality. Just the number of dimensions that inference is innovating is incredible. And this innovation rate is what makes NVIDIA's architecture so great because we -- our ecosystem is fantastic. Everybody knows that if they innovate on top of CUDA and top of NVIDIA's architecture, they can innovate more quickly and they know that everything should work. And if something were to happen, it's probably likely their code and not ours. And so that ability to innovate in every single direction at the same time, having a large installed base so that whatever you create could land on an NVIDIA computer and be deployed broadly all around the world in every single data center all the way out to the edge into robotic systems, that capability is really quite phenomenal.",

And I was wondering if you have a sense like a high-level typical sense of out of an overall AI ecosystem, like maybe one of your clients or one of the large models that are out there. Today, how much of the compute goes into each of these buckets? How much for the pretraining? How much for the reinforcement? And how much into inference today? Do you have any sense for how it's splitting and where the growth is the most important as well? Jensen Huang Well, today, it's vastly in pretraining a foundation model because, as you know, post-training, the new technologies are just coming online. And whatever you could do in pretraining and post-training, you would try to do so that the inference cost could be as low as possible for everyone. However, there are only so many things that you could do a priority. And so you'll always have to do on-the-spot thinking and in context thinking and a reflection. And so I think that the fact that all 3 are scaling is actually very sensible based on where we are. And in the area foundation model, now we have multimodality foundation models and the amount of petabytes video that these foundation models are going to be trained on, it's incredible. And so my expectation is that for the foreseeable future, we're going to be scaling pretraining, post-training as well as inference time scaling and which is the reason why I think we're going to need more and more compute.

The tremendous growth in our business is being fueled by 2 fundamental trends that are driving global adoption of NVIDIA computing. First, the computing stack is undergoing a reinvention, a platform shift from coding to machine learning, from executing code on CPUs to processing neural networks on GPUs. The $1 trillion installed base of traditional data center infrastructure is being rebuilt for Software 2.0, which applies machine learning to produce AI. Second, the age of AI is in full steam. Generative AI is not just a new software capability but a new industry with AI factories manufacturing digital intelligence, a new industrial revolution that can create a multi- trillion-dollar AI industry. Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell, which is now in full production, are incredible for several reasons. There are more foundation model makers now than there were a year ago. The computing scale of pretraining and post-training continues to grow exponentially. There are more AI native startups than ever and the number of successful inference services is rising. And with the introduction of ChatGPT o1, OpenAI o1, a new scaling law called test-time scaling has emerged. All of these consume a great deal of computing. AI is transforming every industry, company and country. Enterprises are adopting agentic AI to revolutionize workflows. Over time, AI coworkers will assist employees in performing their jobs faster and better. Investments in industrial robotics are surging due to breakthroughs in physical AI, driving new training infrastructure demand as researchers train world foundation models on petabytes of video and Omniverse synthetically generated data. The age of robotics is coming. Countries across the world recognize the fundamental AI trends we are seeing and have awakened to the importance of developing their national AI infrastructure. The age of AI is upon us and it's large and diverse. NVIDIA's expertise, scale, and ability to deliver full stack and full infrastructure lets us serve the entire multi-trillion-dollar AI and robotics opportunities ahead from every hyperscale cloud, enterprise private cloud to sovereign regional AI clouds, on-prem to industrial edge and robotics.
