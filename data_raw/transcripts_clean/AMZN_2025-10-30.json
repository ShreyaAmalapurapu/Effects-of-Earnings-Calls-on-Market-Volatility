NasdaqGS:AMZN\nFQ3 2025 Earnings Call Transcripts\nThursday, October 30, 2025 9:00 PM GMT\nS&P Global Market Intelligence Estimates\n\nPresentation\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the\nAmazon.com Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results Teleconference. [Operator\nInstructions]\n\nToday's call is being recorded. And for opening remarks, I will be turning\nthe call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dave Fildes.\nThank you, sir. Please go ahead.\n\nDave Fildes\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nHello, and welcome to our Q3 2025 financial results conference call.\nJoining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian\nOlsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage\nyou to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial\nresults as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note,\nunless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our\nresults for the comparable period of 2024. Our comments and responses to\nyour questions reflect management's views as of today, October 30, 2025\nonly, and will include forward-looking statements.\n\nActual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors\nthat could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's\npress release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent\nannual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\n\nDuring this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In\nour press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with\nthe SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find\nadditional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including\nreconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.\n\nOur guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what\nwe believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently\nunpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and\ngeopolitical conditions, tariff and trade policies, and customer demand and\nspending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest\nrates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth\nof the Internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging\ntechnologies and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.\nOur guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any\nadditional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements.\nIt's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services,\nand therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our\nguidance.\n\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Andy.\n\nAndrew R. Jassy\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Dave. We saw strong growth across our business in Q3, and we're\nreporting $180.2 billion in revenue, up 12% year-over-year, excluding the\nimpact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income was $17.4 billion, but\nwould have been over $21 billion if not for 2 special Q3 expenses, $2.5\nbillion for an FTC settlement and $1.8 billion for estimated severance\ncosts. Trailing 12-month free cash flow was $14.8 billion.\n\nI'll start with AWS. AWS is growing at a pace we haven't seen since 2022,\nreaccelerating to 20.2% year-over-year, our largest growth rate in 11\nquarters. It's worth remembering that year-over-year percentage growth is a\nrelative term. It's very different having 20% year-over-year growth on a\n$132 billion annualized run rate than to have a higher percentage growth\nrate on a meaningfully smaller annual revenue, which is the case with our\ncompetitors.\n\nBacklog grew to $200 billion by Q3 quarter end and doesn't include several\nunannounced new deals in October, which together are more than our total\ndeal volume for all of Q3. AWS is gaining momentum. Customers want to be\nrunning their core and AI workloads in AWS given its stronger\nfunctionality, security, and operational performance, and the scale I see\nin front of us gives me significant confidence in what lies ahead. I'll\nshare a little more detail on why.\n\nIt starts with AWS having much broader infrastructure functionality. Start-\nups, enterprises, and governments want to move their production workloads\nto the place that has the broadest and deepest array of capabilities. AWS\nhas more services and deeper features within those services than anybody\nelse and continues to innovate at a rapid clip. These are key building\nblocks for anything that customers want to create, and they're a big part\nof why Gartner has named AWS leader in its strategic cloud platform\nservices Magic Quadrant for 15 consecutive years.\n\nWe're bringing the same building block approach to AI. SageMaker makes it\nmuch simpler for companies to build and deploy their own foundation models.\nBedrock gives customers leading selection of foundation models and superior\nprice performance to deploy inference into their next-generation\napplications. A lot of the future value companies will get from AI will be\nin the form of agents. AWS is heavily investing in this area and well\npositioned to be a leader.\n\nCompanies will both create their own agents and use agents from other\ncompanies. For those building their own, it's been harder to build than it\nshould be. It's why we launched Strands to make it much easier to create\nagents from any foundation model that builders desire. For companies who\nsuccessfully built agents, they've hesitated putting them into production\nbecause they lack secure, scalable runtime services or memory or\nobservability, built specifically for agents. It's why we launched\nAgentCore, a set of infrastructure building blocks that allow builders to\ndeploy secure, scalable agents. Ericsson used AgentCore to deliver AI\nagents across their workforce, Sony used it to build a agentic AI platform\nwith enterprise-level security, observability, and scalability. And Cohere\nHealth is using AgentCore to deploy agents that will reduce medical review\ntimes by up to 30% to 40%. AgentCore's SDK has already been downloaded over\n1 million times, and our builders are excited about it. It's an enabler.\n\nCompanies will also use other agents, and AWS continues to build many of\nthe agents we believe builders will use in the future. For coding, we've\nrecently opened up our agentic coding IDE called Kiro. More than 100,000\ndevelopers jumped into Kiro in just the first few days of preview, and that\nnumber has more than doubled since. It's processed trillions of tokens thus\nfar, weekly actives are growing fast, and developers love its unique spec\nand tool calling capabilities. For migration and transformation, we offer\nan agent called Transform. Year-to-date, customers have already used it to\nsave 700,000 hours of manual effort, the equivalent of 335 developer years\nof work. For example, Thomson Reuters used it to transform 1.5 million\nlines of code per month, moving from Windows to open source alternatives\nand completing tasks or at times faster than with other migration tools.\n\nCustomers have also already used Transform to analyze nearly 1 billion\nlines of mainframe code as they move mainframe applications to the cloud.\nFor business customers, we've recently launched Quick Suite to bring a\nconsumer AI-like experience to work, making it easy to find insights,\nconduct deep research, automate tasks, visualize data, and take actions.\nWe've already seen users churn months-long projects into days, get 80% plus\ntime savings on complex tasks, and realize 90% plus cost savings. And for\ncontact centers, we offer Amazon Connect, which creates a more personalized\nand efficient experience for contact center agents, managers, and their\ncustomers. Connect has recently crested $1 billion annualized revenue run\nrate with 12 billion minutes of customer interactions being handled by AI\nin the last year and is being used by large enterprises like Capital One,\nToyota, American Airlines, and Ryanair. These are real practical results\nfor customers, and there are many more examples like them.\n\nBecause of its advantaged capabilities, security, operational performance,\nand customer focus, AWS continues to earn most of the big enterprise and\ngovernment transformations to the cloud. As a result, AWS is where the\npreponderance of company's data and workloads reside and part of why most\ncompanies want to run AI in AWS. To enable customers to do so, we need to\nhave the requisite capacity, and we've been focused on accelerating\ncapacity the last several months, adding more than 3.8 gigawatts of power\nin the past 12 months, more than any other cloud provider.\n\nTo put that into perspective, we're now double the power capacity that AWS\nwas in 2022, and we're on track to double again by 2027. In the last\nquarter of this year alone, we expect to add at least another 1 gigawatt of\npower. This capacity consists of power, data center, and chips, primarily\nour custom silicon, Trainium and NVIDIA. We've recently brought Project\nRainier online, our massive AI compute cluster spanning multiple U.S. data\ncenters and containing nearly 500,000 of our Trainium2 chips. Anthropic is\nusing it now to build and deploy its industry-leading AI model, Claude,\nwhich we expect to be on more than 1 million Trainium2 chips by year-end.\nTrainium2 continues to see strong adoption, is fully subscribed, and is now\na multibillion-dollar business that grew 150% quarter-over-quarter.\n\nToday, Trainium is being used by a small number of very large customers,\nbut we expect to accommodate more customers starting with Trainium3. We're\nbuilding Bedrock to be the biggest inference engine in the world and in the\nlong run, believe Bedrock could be as big a business for AWS as EC2, and\nthe majority of token usage in Amazon Bedrock is already running on\nTrainium. We're also continuing to work closely with chip partners like\nNVIDIA, with whom we continue to order very significant amounts as well as\nwith AMD and Intel. These are very important partners with whom we expect\nto keep growing our relationships over time.\n\nYou're going to see us continue to be very aggressive investing in capacity\nbecause we see the demand. As fast as we're adding capacity right now,\nwe're monetizing it. It's still quite early and represents an unusual\nopportunity for customers in AWS.\n\nI'll now turn to stores. Where the team continues to deliver and innovate\nfor customers across our key priorities, selection, low prices, and\nconvenience, particularly fast delivery, we're offering 14% more selection\nsince last quarter from popular brands like The North Face and Charlotte\nTilbury, and we've added hundreds of thousands of items from popular brands\nthis year. Everyday Essentials continues to grow quickly, and year-to-date\nis growing nearly twice as fast as the rest of the business. We continue to\nmake it easier for customers to order low-priced perishable groceries from\nAmazon, and customers in more than 1,000 cities and towns now can shop\nfresh groceries alongside millions of Amazon.com products with free same-\nday delivery. This is a game changer for customers who can now order milk\nalongside electronics, check out with one cart, and have everything\ndelivered to their doorstep within hours.\n\nThe team also invented a new Add to Delivery button that lets customers add\nitems to previously scheduled orders, and it's been used more than 80\nmillion times since launch, and it's just launched. It's an example of one\nof those seemingly simple but powerful innovations that make customers'\nlives easier. We remain committed to staying sharp on price and meeting or\nbeating prices of other major retailers. In July, we had our biggest Prime\nDay event ever, with customers saving billions of dollars across more than\n35 categories. We continue to break records on speed. We're on track to\ndeliver at our fastest speeds ever for Prime members globally once again\nthis year, and we've started rolling out 3-hour delivery in select U.S.\ncities.\n\nWe're also continuing to invest in infrastructure to speed up rural\ndeliveries and serve more customers in more communities. That includes\ncommitting over $4 billion to expand our rural delivery network across the\nU.S. These are small towns where people want fast delivery, but where other\ncompanies have been backing out and reducing service. In contrast, we've\nalready increased the number of rural communities with access to our same-\nday and next-day delivery by 60%, reaching roughly half of the total\ncommunities we plan to expand to by the end of the year.\n\nThe stores team is also innovating rapidly with AI. For example, Rufus, our\nAI-powered shopping assistant, has had 250 million active customers this\nyear with monthly users up 140% year-over-year, interactions up 210% year-\nover-year, and customers using Rufus during a shopping trip being 60% more\nlikely to complete a purchase. Rufus is on track to deliver over $10\nbillion in incremental annualized sales.\n\nHere are the highlights. Our generative AI-powered audio feature that\ncombines product summaries and reviews to make shopping easier has expanded\nfrom hundreds of products at launch to millions of products, and millions\nof customers have used it, streaming almost 3 million minutes. In Amazon\nLens, an AI-powered visual search tool that lets customers find products\nwith their phone's camera, a screenshot, or a barcode, now includes Lens\nLive, which instantly scans products and shows real-time matches in a\nswipeable carousel. Tens of millions of customers are using Amazon Lens\neach month.\n\nMoving on to Amazon Ads. We're pleased with the continued strong growth,\ngenerating $17.6 billion of revenue in the quarter and growing 22% year-\nover-year. We see strength across our broad portfolio of full photo\nadvertising offerings that helps advertisers reach an average ad-supported\naudience of more than 300 million in the U.S. alone. We also continue to be\nexcited about our demand-side platform, Amazon DSP, which lets advertisers\nplan, activate, and measure full-funnel investments.\n\nLast quarter, I mentioned our partnership with Roku, and we've built on\nthat with a partnership with Netflix, providing advertisers using Amazon\nDSP with direct access to Netflix's premium ad inventory. We announced\nintegrations with Spotify and SiriusXM. With Spotify, we provide\nadvertisers with direct programmatic access to a global audience of more\nthan 400 million monthly ad-supported listeners. And with SiriusXM, brands\ncan reach 160 million monthly digital listeners across services like\nPandora and SoundCloud, and we're excited about the advertising opportunity\naround Prime Video live sports. Live sports got a lot of interest from\nadvertisers in upfront negotiations for 2025, '26, and we exceeded our own\nexpectations for upfront commitments with significant growth across the\nboard.\n\nFinally, we're continuing to innovate for advertisers with AI. For example,\nin September, we announced an Agentic AI tool and creative studio that\nplans and executes the entire creative process in a matter of hours instead\nof weeks. We're also inventing and seeing strong momentum in several other\nareas, and I'll mention just a few. In Prime Video live sports, NBA on\nPrime tipped off last week, and our opening night doubleheader averaged\n1.25 million viewers in the U.S., a double-digit increase over last season\non cable. You'll see us bring the same constant innovation here that we\nbrought to our NFL broadcast. We're adding golf with The Masters in 2026\nand new skins competition with the PGA Tour on Black Friday this year. And\nwe've added Peacock and FOX One to Prime Video's add-on subscription\noffering of over 100 channels in the U.S.\n\nWe continue to be energized by the response to Alexa+ compared to what we\ncall the classic Alexa experience. Alexa+ customers are talking to Alexa 2x\nmore. Those interactions are much longer, and they're covering a broader\nrange of topics. So using Alexa+ and Fire TV at 2.5x the rate of classic,\nusing natural conversation to discover audio content 4x more, engaging with\nphotos 4x more, and customers are completing 4x more shopping conversations\nthat end in a purchase.\n\nWe've expanded the number of project hyper satellites in space to more than\n150 and delivered over 1 gigabit per second speeds and tests with our\nenterprise-grade customer terminal, the first commercial phased array we\nknow of to clear that threshold. Finally, Zoox robotaxis are available to\nriders in Las Vegas, and we've announced Washington D.C. as the eighth\ntesting location. We're excited for these to continue rolling out to more\nriders. Q4 is one of our busiest and most energizing times of the year, and\nwe're excited about the continued demand for AWS, the innovations we will\nannounce re:Invent in December, the positive customer response to our AI-\npowered experiences, all the guests will be delivering throughout the\nholiday season, and a lot more. Thanks in advance to our teammates around\nthe world who are gearing up to deliver for customers once again.\n\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update.\n\nBrian T. Olsavsky\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Andy. Starting with our top-line financial results. Worldwide\nrevenue was $180.2 billion, a 12% increase year-over-year, excluding a 90\nbasis point favorable impact of foreign exchange. In Q3, we reported\nworldwide operating income of $17.4 billion. This operating income includes\n2 special charges, which reduced operating income by $4.3 billion. The\nfirst charge of $2.5 billion is related to a legal settlement with the\nFederal Trade Commission, which impacts the North America segment and is\nrecorded in the other operating expense line.\n\nThe second charge of $1.8 billion relates to severance costs for role\neliminations and impacts all 3 of our segments. This severance charge is\nrecorded primarily in the technology and infrastructure, sales and\nmarketing, and general and administrative expense line items. Excluding\nthese 2 charges, worldwide operating income would have been $21.7 billion\nor $1.2 billion above the high end of our guidance range.\n\nMoving to our segment results. We remain encouraged by the innovation our\nteams are delivering for customers across all 3 segments. In the North\nAmerica segment, third quarter revenue was $106.3 billion, an increase of\n11% year-over-year. International segment revenue was $40.9 billion, an\nincrease of 10% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.\nWorldwide paid units grew 11% year-over-year. We continue to prioritize the\ninputs that matter most to our customers. In the third quarter, our sharp\npricing, broad selection, and fast delivery speeds continue to resonate\nwith customers. Customers appreciate the ability to quickly receive items\nessential for their daily needs, including perishable groceries, and have\nthem delivered in the same day. Our millions of global third-party sellers\ncontinue to be important contributors to our vast selection, which helps\ncustomers find the items they need at competitive prices.\n\nWe're committed to building innovative services and features for our\nsellers, including our ongoing advancements in generative AI. Today, more\nthan 1.3 million sellers have used our generative AI capabilities to more\nquickly launch high-quality listings. Better listings translate into better\ntraction with customers. And in Q3, worldwide third-party seller unit mix\nwas 62%, up 200 basis points from Q3 of last year.\n\nShifting to profitability. North America segment operating income was $4.8\nbillion, with an operating margin of 4.5%. Excluding the $2.5 billion\ncharge related to the legal settlement with the FTC, North America segment\noperating income would have been $7.3 billion with an operating margin of\n6.9%. North America segment operating margin also includes a portion of the\nseverance charge. International segment operating income was $1.2 billion,\nwith an operating margin of 2.9%. Excluding the impact of the severance\ncharge, International segment operating margins expanded year-over-year.\n\nGlobally, our progress on key inputs is delivering a better customer\nexperience while driving a more efficient cost structure. For example,\nwe're making notable strides in improving inventory placement to speed up\ndelivery to customers. And as a result, for the third year in a row, we are\non track to deliver our fastest speeds ever for Prime members in 2025. We\ncontinue to tune and improve our fulfillment operations, and our\nregionalized network is operating at scale. We see many benefits from our\ninbound process improvements, including a reduction of U.S. inbound lead\ntime by nearly 4 days compared to last year. This allows us to be more\nefficient with our inventory purchasing, which benefits working capital.\nWe're also placing inventory more strategically throughout the network. And\nby leveraging our existing infrastructure, we're now offering U.S.\ncustomers the ability to order perishable groceries and receive them the\nsame day in as little as 5 hours.\n\nWe're seeing positive early results since launching in January when\ncustomers start shopping fresh groceries on Amazon, they are visiting the\nsite more often and returning twice as often as nonperishable shoppers.\nLooking ahead, we see further opportunity to improve productivity in our\nglobal fulfillment and transportation network. We will continue to improve\ninventory placement to drive down distance traveled and touches per\npackage. We will also build on the gains from our regionalized network\nthrough algorithmic improvements as well as launching robotics and\nautomation. Operating margin may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, we have a\ndeliberate approach to achieve sustained progress over the long term.\n\nShifting to advertising. Advertising revenue was $17.7 billion, and growth\naccelerated for the third consecutive quarter. We continue to see strong\ngrowth on an increasingly large base, as our full funnel advertising\napproach of connecting brands with customers is resonating.\n\nMoving next to our AWS segment. Revenue was $33 billion, up 20.2% year-over-\nyear. This is an acceleration of 270 basis points compared to last quarter,\ndriven by strong growth across both our AI and core services and more\ncapacity, which has come online to support customer demand. AWS revenue\nincreased $2.1 billion quarter-over-quarter and now has an annualized\nrevenue run rate of $132 billion. AWS operating income was $11.4 billion\nand reflects our continued growth, coupled with our focus on driving\nefficiencies across the business.\n\nWe are expanding our data center footprint, largely to accommodate Gen AI.\nAnd to the extent those assets were placed into service, the related\ndepreciation does impact our margins. As we've long said, we expect AWS\noperating margins to fluctuate over time, driven in part by the level of\ninvestments we're making at any point in time.\n\nNow turning to our cash CapEx, which was $34.2 billion in Q3. We've now\nspent $89.9 billion so far this year. This primarily relates to AWS as we\ninvest to support demand for our AI and core services and in custom\nsilicon, like Trainium, as well as tech infrastructure to support our North\nAmerica and International segments. We'll continue to make significant\ninvestments, especially in AI, as we believe it to be a massive opportunity\nwith the potential for strong returns on invested capital over the long\nterm.\n\nAdditionally, we continue to invest in our fulfillment and transportation\nnetwork to support the growth of the business, improve delivery speeds, and\nlower our cost to serve. These investments will support growth for many\nyears to come. Looking ahead, we expect our full year cash CapEx to be\napproximately $125 billion in 2025, and we expect that amount will increase\nin 2026.\n\nI'll finish up my remarks with net income. While we primarily focus our\ncomments on operating income, our third quarter net income of $21.2 billion\nincludes a pretax gain of $9.5 billion related to our investment in\nAnthropic. This investment activity is not related to Amazon's ongoing\noperations and is included in nonoperating income. We're encouraged by the\nstart of the peak season, and we are ready to serve customers in the coming\nmonths. I want to thank our teams across Amazon for their hard work as we\nget ready to delight customers during the holiday season. Our commitment to\nelevating the customer experience is the only reliable way to drive\nsustainable value for our shareholders.\nWith that, let's move on to your questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of\nJustin Post with Bank of America.\n\nJustin Post\nBofA Securities, Research Division\n\nI'll ask on AWS. Can you just kind of go through how you're feeling about\nyour capacity levels and how capacity constrained you are right now? And\nthen in your prepared remarks, you mentioned Trainium3 demand and maybe\nbroadening out your customer base. Can you talk about the demand you're\nseeing outside of your major customers for Trainium?\n\nAndrew R. Jassy\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nYes. On the capacity side, we brought in quite a bit of capacity, as I\nmentioned in my opening comments, 3.8 gigawatts of capacity in the last\nyear with another gigawatt plus coming in the fourth quarter, and we expect\nto double our overall capacity by the end of 2027. So we're bringing in\nquite a bit of capacity today; overall in the industry, maybe the\nbottleneck is power. I think at some point, it may move to chips, but we're\nbringing in quite a bit of capacity. And as fast as we're bringing in right\nnow, we are monetizing it.\n\nAnd then on the Trainium demand, outside of our major customers. So first\nof all, as I mentioned on Trainium2, it's really doing well. It's fully\nsubscribed on Trainium2. We have -- it's a multibillion-dollar business at\nthis point. It grew 150% quarter-over-quarter in revenue. And you see\nreally big projects at scale now, like our Project Rainier that we're doing\nwith Anthropic, where they're running their next version of -- they're\ntraining the next version of Claude on top of Trainium2 on 500,000\nTrainium2 chips going to 1 million Trainium2 chips by the end of the year.\n\nAs I mentioned, we have -- today, with Trainium2, we have a small number of\nvery large customers on it. But because Trainium is 30% to 40% more price\nperformant than other options out there, and because as customers, as they\nstart to contemplate broader scale of their production workloads, moving to\nbeing AI-focused and using inference, they badly care about price\nperformance. And so we have a lot of demand for Trainium. Trainium3 should\npreview at the end of this year with much fuller volumes coming in the\nbeginning of '26. We have a lot of customers, both very large, and I'll\ncall it, medium-sized who're quite interested in Trainium3.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan\nStanley.\n\nBrian Thomas Nowak\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\n\nCongrats on the quarter, guys. So maybe 2. One, Andy, sort of a\nphilosophical chip question. There's a lot of questions in the market about\nTrainium and sort of its positioning versus other third-party chips. So how\ndo you think about the key hurdles of Trainium3 needs to overcome to really\nmake Trainium adoption broader, to your point on the last question, and\ncontinue to drive Trainium as opposed to satisfying what could be broader\ndemand with third-party chips in the near term?\n\nAndrew R. Jassy\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nYes. Well, first of all, we're always going to have multiple chip options\nfor our customers. It's been true in every major technology building block\nor component that we've had in AWS. Really in the history of AWS, it's\nnever just one player that over a long period of time has the entire market\nsegment and then it can satisfy everybody's needs on every dimension. And\nso we have a very deep relationship with NVIDIA. We have for a very long\ntime. And we will for as long as I can foresee the future. We buy a lot of\nNVIDIA. We are not constrained in any way in buying NVIDIA, and I expect\nthat we'll continue to buy more NVIDIA both next year and in the future.\n\nBut we're different from most technology companies in that we have our own\nvery strong chip team, and this is our Annapurna team. And you saw it first\non the CPU side with what we built with Graviton, which is about 40% better\nprice performance than the other x86 processors, and you're seeing it again\non the custom silicon on the AI side with Trainium, which is about the same\namount of price performance benefit for customers relative to other GPU\noptions.\n\nAnd our customers to be able to use AI as expansively as they want. And\nremember, it's still relatively early days at this point. They're going to\nneed better price performance, and they care about it deeply. And so I\nmentioned earlier the momentum that Trainium2 has. And I think that for us,\nas we think about Trainium3, I expect Trainium3 will be about 40% better\nthan Trainium2, and Trainium2 is already very advantaged on price\nperformance.\n\nSo we have to, of course, deliver the chip. We have to deliver it in\nvolumes and deliver it quickly. And we have to continue to work on the\nsoftware ecosystem, which gets better all the time. And as we have more\nproof points like we have with Project Rainier with what Anthropic is doing\non Trainium2, it builds increasing credibility for Trainium, and I think\ncustomers are very bullish about it. I'm bullish about it as well.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\n\nDouglas Till Anmuth\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nI'll stick with basically the same topic, Andy. But can you just talk a\nlittle bit about the architecture of Project Rainier and how it's\ndifferentiated and what that means for customers and for AWS? And do you\nexpect Rainier to expand beyond Anthropic? And how do you replicate Rainier\nwith Trainium3 chips?\n\nAndrew R. Jassy\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nYes. I think what is compelling for Anthropic around Project Rainier is --\nreally is the Trainium2 chip, which -- we built a very -- first of all, we\nbuilt a very large cluster that they can use in a very expansive way. And\nit's not simple to be able to build a cluster that has 500,000 plus chips\ngoing to 1 million. That's an infrastructure feat that's hard to do at\nscale. And so some piece of it is the infrastructure capabilities that\nwe've built over a long period of time in AWS that is unusual in the\nindustry. But it's just also the performance of the chip and the price\nperformance, both of which matter.\n\nAnd I think that Project Rainier is something that is specific for\nAnthropic, but we have a lot of other customers who are interested in\nemploying large clusters of Trainium chips that we're going to hopefully\ngive them a chance to do so with Trainium3.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.\n\nMark Stephen F. Mahaney\nEvercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division\n\nI want to ask about 2 topics, groceries and then how to think about\nheadcount in the future. And on groceries, I want to -- the perishables, I\nthink last quarter, you talked about 70% or something of users had never\npurchased perishables from Amazon before. Just talk about whether you -- I\nthink you used the term, game changer, before. Does this mean that maybe we\ndon't -- you no longer need to Amazon Fresh stores? You always had this\nDVD, Delivery Van Density, advantage. And have you kind of reached a point\nyou think of scale and speed that you really can change people's habits and\nreally have them consider Amazon as one of their first grocery options? Do\nyou really feel like you're at that point?\n\nAnd then secondly, just on the headcount, some of the recent news. Just\ntalk to us about how you think about headcount going forward? Are you\nseeing -- is the level of efficiencies that you're getting from AI such\nthat you can keep headcount relatively flattish for the foreseeable future?\nJust talk about the pros and cons or the wins and losses in terms of that\nheadcount going forward.\n\nAndrew R. Jassy\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nYes. So I'll start with grocery, Mark. We have a very large grocery\nbusiness. If you look at our entire grocery business, if I don't even count\nWhole Foods Market and Fresh, in the last 12 months to over $100 billion of\ngross merchandising sales, which would make us a top 3 grocery in the U.S.\nA good chunk of it is a lot of the items that you'd find in the middle\naisle, so consumables and canned goods and pet food and health and beauty,\nvery significant and continues to grow at a very good clip.\n\nBut then we also have Whole Foods Market, which is the pioneer in organic\nfoods, which is also growing at a faster clip than most grocery companies\nwith an attractive trajectory on profitability, and we'll expand our Whole\nFoods physical presence over the coming years here. And I'm also very\nexcited about this new concept, daily shop that we have, which is a smaller\nversion of Whole Foods in urban settings, which we have 3 that we've\nlaunched that are off to very good starts that you should expect to see\nmore of as well.\n\nAnd we have always been -- as you referenced, we've talked a lot about\nhaving a larger mass physical presence. And we continue to experiment with\nvarious formats. But the one that we are most excited about is what you\nreferenced, which is the ability to provide perishable groceries with same-\nday deliveries. And if you think about how many of our customers are buying\nfrom us multiple times a week and who are buying things like shampoo or\ndetergent or paper cups or water, where the ability to add milk and eggs\nand yogurt and other perishables to their order and have it live in the\nsame shop in cart and then show up a few hours later is very compelling.\n\nAnd we started with a few markets about a year ago, and we were really\ntaken aback at the adoption, not just the number of people that started\nbuying perishables from us very quickly, but how often they came back\ndownstream to buy perishables and groceries from us in the future. And so\nwe've now expanded that to 1,000 cities around the U.S. and will be in\n2,300 by the end of the year. And it's really changing the trajectory and\nthe size of our grocery business.\n\nAnd I also believe that this many years tradition of the weekly stock-up,\ngrocery stock-up is changing. And I think we're a big part of that. And I\nthink there's a lot of potential there for the grocery side. It doesn't\nmean that we won't continue to experiment with other physical formats, but\nwe're on to something very significant with what we're doing with\nperishables from our same-day facilities.\n\nAnd then on your headcount question, what I would tell you is the\nannouncement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven,\nand it's not even really AI-driven, not right now, at least. It really --\nit's culture. And if you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size\nof businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of\nbusinesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had\nbefore, and you end up with a lot more layers.\n\nAnd when that happens, sometimes without realizing it, you can weaken the\nownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work and who\nown most of the 2-way door decisions, the ones that should be made quickly\nand right at the front line, and it can lead to slowing you down. As a\nleadership team, we are committed to operating like the world's largest\nstart-up. And that means removing layers. It means increasing the amount of\nownership that people have, and it means inventing and moving quickly.\n\nAnd I don't know if there's ever been a time in the history of Amazon or\nmaybe business in general with the technology transformation happening\nright now, where it's important to be lean, it's important to be flat, and\nit's important to move fast, and that's what we're going to do.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman\nSachs.\n\nEric James Sheridan\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\n\nWanted to know, Andy, if you could reflect on the opportunity that's\ncontinuing to present itself in terms of rolling out more robotics and\nautomation and the broader theme of physical AI across your operations? And\nhow should we be thinking about that as a driver of potential efficiencies,\nbut also as a driver of the ability to possibly reinvest back in the\nbusiness over the long term?\n\nAndrew R. Jassy\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nRobotics is a very substantial area of investment for us. We have over 1\nmillion robots in our fulfillment network at this point. And I would say\nthat while that's significant, we have a lot of invention in flight. So I\nexpect that we'll have more over a period of time. Robotics are very\nimportant for us and for our customers and for our teammates because they\nimprove safety, they boost productivity, they increase speed, and they let\nour human teammates focus on problem-solving and what they do best.\n\nAnd we expect that our people remain at the heart in the center of our\nfulfillment network as they have from when we first started working with\nrobotics. And we expect that over time, we will have a fulfillment network\nwhere robots and humans complement each other and work together. But I\nthink you're going to continue to see us invest very significantly in\nrobotics. It's going to help on the safety, the productivity, the speed,\nand ultimately some of the cost pieces, which will allow us to continue to\nimprove the customer experience.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with TD Cowen.\n\nJohn Ryan Blackledge\nTD Cowen, Research Division\n\nHow does Amazon think about agentic commerce going forward? And how do you\nthink Amazon will serve customers using agents to purchase goods on Amazon\nin the future?\n\nAndrew R. Jassy\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nI'm very excited about -- and as a business, we're very excited about in\nthe long term the prospect of agentic commerce. And it has a chance to be\ngood for customers; it has a chance to be really good for e-commerce. And I\nthink if you're -- if you know what you want to buy, there are a few\nexperiences that are better than coming to Amazon. But if you don't know\nwhat you want, it's -- physical store with a physical salesperson still has\nsome advantages. Obviously, lots of people do it on Amazon all the time.\nBut you very often want to ask questions and help -- get help narrowing\nwhat you're going to look for. And as you keep asking new questions, having\na whole bunch of different options presented to you.\n\nAnd I think AI and agentic commerce are going to change the experience\nonline where that experience where you're narrowing what you want when you\ndon't know is going to get better online than it even is in physical\nenvironments.\n\nNow we obviously have our own efforts here in agentic commerce. We have\nRufus, which I talked about in my opening comments, which is continuing to\nget better and better and used more broadly. And we have features like Buy\nfor Me, where we will surface on Amazon, even items that we don't stock\nthat other merchants have. And then if customers want us to go and buy it\nfor them on those merchants' websites, we will do that. And both of those\nhave been successful for us. But we're also having conversations with and\nexpect over time to partner with third-party agents. And I think that it\nreminds me in some ways of the beginning of search engines many years ago\nbeing sources of discovery for commerce. And you had to kind of figure out\nthe right way to work together.\n\nAnd today, search engines are a very small part of our referral traffic,\nand third-party agents are a very small subset of that. But I do think that\nwe will find ways to partner. We have to find a way, though, that makes the\ncustomer experience good. Right now, I would say the customer experience is\nnot. There's no personalization, there's no shopping history, the delivery\nestimates are frequently wrong, the prices are often wrong.\n\nSo we've got to find a way to make the customer experience better and have\nthe right exchange value. But I do think that the exciting part of this and\nthe promise is that AI and agentic commerce solutions are going to expand\nthe amount of shopping that happens online. And I think that's really good\nfor customers, and I think it's really good for Amazon because at the end\nof the day, you're going to buy from the outfit that allows you to have the\nbroadest selection, great value, and continues to deliver for you very\nquickly and reliably. And I think that bodes well for us.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our final question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird.\n\nColin Alan Sebastian\nRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\n\nI guess first on AWS, following up there. How much of this acceleration is\ndriven by core infrastructure versus AI workload monetization? And I think\npart of it is trying to understand how important newer services like\nAgentCore are becoming and bringing enterprises to AWS to build agents? And\nthen I guess, secondly, regarding the acceleration in advertising, if you\ncould potentially disaggregate the core advertising contribution versus DSP\nand Prime Video, that would be helpful as well.\n\nAndrew R. Jassy\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nI'll start on the AWS side. We are seeing -- we're really pleased with the\nresults from this quarter, 20% year-over-year on an annualized run rate of\n$132 billion is unusual. And we have momentum. You can see it. And we see\nthe growth in both our AI area, where we see it in inference. We see it in\ntraining. We see it in the use of our Trainium custom silicon. Bedrock\ncontinues to grow really quickly. SageMaker continues to grow quickly. And\nI think that the number of companies who are working on building agents is\nvery significant. I do believe that a lot of the value that companies will\nrealize over time in AI will come from agents.\n\nAnd I think that building agents today is still harder than it should be.\nYou need tools to make it easier, which is why we built Strands, which is\nan open-source capability that lets people build agents from any model that\nthey can imagine. But even more so, when you talk to enterprises or\ncompanies that care a lot about security and scale, they're starting to\nbuild agents, and they don't really feel like they've got -- they've had\nbuilding blocks that allow them to have the type of secure, scalable agents\nthat they need to bet their businesses and their customer experience and\ntheir data on.\n\nAnd that's why -- that was really the inspiration behind AgentCore was to\nbuild another set of primitive building blocks like we built in the early\ndays of AWS, where it was compute and storage and database. We defined a\nset of building blocks that you needed to be able to deploy agents securely\nand scalably that we provide in AgentCore. And then when we talk to our\ncustomers, it really resonates. There is not anything else like it, it's\nchanging their time frame and their receptivity to building agents, and\nit's very compelling for them.\n\nSo I do think the combination of what we're doing to enable agents to be\nbuilt and run securely and scalably, as well as some of the agents that\nwe're building ourselves that our customers are excited about, are\ncompelling for them. And I think the other place we see a lot of growth in\nAWS also is just the number of enterprises who are -- who have gotten back\nto moving from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud. And we continue to\nearn the lion's share of those transformations. And I look at the momentum\nwe have right now, and I believe that we can continue to grow at a clip\nlike this for a while.\n\nI think on the advertising side, that is also an area where I think\ncollectively, we feel very pleased about the progress. Every single one of\nour advertising offerings this quarter grew in a meaningful way. I think\nthere's a few things going on for us. We have what I think of as a pretty\nunusual full-funnel offering. And if you look at the top of the funnel,\nwhich typically tends to be awareness building and broad scale, to be able\nto use our own Prime Video and our live sports capabilities as well as\ngoing all the way down to the bottom of the funnel at point of sale being\nable to use sponsored products, that's -- most people don't have a full-\nfunnel offering as robust as that. And then when you layer on top of it,\nthe combination of the audience curation and development we can do, along\nwith the advantage measurement, it just all leads to a return on\nadvertising spend is very unusual.\n\nAnd I think there are multiple places where we can expect to continue to\ngrow. One is in our stores business. I still think if you look at the\nworldwide market segment share of retail, still 80% to 85% of it lives in\nphysical stores. And that equation is going to flip over time. And I think\nAI is going to only accelerate that. So I think we have an opportunity -- a\nsignificant opportunity still in our existing stores. And then I think\nvideo, we've only been at this for a little bit of time, but it's already a\nvery large amount of advertising revenue, and we're still relatively early\nstage.\n\nI think that will continue to be a big area of growth. And then as you\nreferenced, the amount -- their demand-side platform or Amazon DSP, that is\ngrowing really quickly as well. Some of it had to do with the fact that we\nhad some features. We always had a number of the core components people\nwanted around some of our properties, the measurement capabilities, Amazon\nMarketing Cloud, but we lacked some features for a while as we were\nbuilding out our DSP that customers told us mattered, and the team over the\nlast 20 months have closed those gaps in a very significant way so that now\npeople feel like our DSP is fully featured.\n\nAnd then you look at some of the partnerships that we've done, the Roku\npartnership gives us the largest connected TV footprint in the U.S. And you\nlayer on top of that, what we've recently done in providing our DSP\ncustomers the opportunity to integrate with the ad inventory in Netflix and\nSpotify and SiriusXM; it's powerful. And so we are growing very quickly on\nthe demand-side platform. So very optimistic about what we're doing there.\nWe've work to do, obviously, but I don't think we're close to being able to\ngrow there.\n\nOperatorThanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions.

  "presentation_text": "Operator\n\nThank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the\nAmazon.com Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results Teleconference. [Operator\nInstructions]\n\nToday's call is being recorded. And for opening remarks, I will be turning\nthe call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dave Fildes.\nThank you, sir. Please go ahead.\n\nDave Fildes\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nHello, and welcome to our Q3 2025 financial results conference call.\nJoining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian\nOlsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage\nyou to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial\nresults as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note,\nunless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our\nresults for the comparable period of 2024. Our comments and responses to\nyour questions reflect management's views as of today, October 30, 2025\nonly, and will include forward-looking statements.\n\nActual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors\nthat could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's\npress release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent\nannual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\n\nDuring this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In\nour press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with\nthe SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find\nadditional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including\nreconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.\n\nOur guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what\nwe believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently\nunpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and\ngeopolitical conditions, tariff and trade policies, and customer demand and\nspending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest\nrates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth\nof the Internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging\ntechnologies and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.\nOur guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any\nadditional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements.\nIt's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services,\nand therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our\nguidance.\n\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Andy.\n\nAndrew R. Jassy\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Dave. We saw strong growth across our business in Q3, and we're\nreporting $180.2 billion in revenue, up 12% year-over-year, excluding the\nimpact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income was $17.4 billion, but\nwould have been over $21 billion if not for 2 special Q3 expenses, $2.5\nbillion for an FTC settlement and $1.8 billion for estimated severance\ncosts. Trailing 12-month free cash flow was $14.8 billion.\n\nI'll start with AWS. AWS is growing at a pace we haven't seen since 2022,\nreaccelerating to 20.2% year-over-year, our largest growth rate in 11\nquarters. It's worth remembering that year-over-year percentage growth is a\nrelative term. It's very different having 20% year-over-year growth on a\n$132 billion annualized run rate than to have a higher percentage growth\nrate on a meaningfully smaller annual revenue, which is the case with our\ncompetitors.\n\nBacklog grew to $200 billion by Q3 quarter end and doesn't include several\nunannounced new deals in October, which together are more than our total\ndeal volume for all of Q3. AWS is gaining momentum. Customers want to be\nrunning their core and AI workloads in AWS given its stronger\nfunctionality, security, and operational performance, and the scale I see\nin front of us gives me significant confidence in what lies ahead. I'll\nshare a little more detail on why.\n\nIt starts with AWS having much broader infrastructure functionality. Start-\nups, enterprises, and governments want to move their production workloads\nto the place that has the broadest and deepest array of capabilities. AWS\nhas more services and deeper features within those services than anybody\nelse and continues to innovate at a rapid clip. These are key building\nblocks for anything that customers want to create, and they're a big part\nof why Gartner has named AWS leader in its strategic cloud platform\nservices Magic Quadrant for 15 consecutive years.\n\nWe're bringing the same building block approach to AI. SageMaker makes it\nmuch simpler for companies to build and deploy their own foundation models.\nBedrock gives customers leading selection of foundation models and superior\nprice performance to deploy inference into their next-generation\napplications. A lot of the future value companies will get from AI will be\nin the form of agents. AWS is heavily investing in this area and well\npositioned to be a leader.\n\nCompanies will both create their own agents and use agents from other\ncompanies. For those building their own, it's been harder to build than it\nshould be. It's why we launched Strands to make it much easier to create\nagents from any foundation model that builders desire. For companies who\nsuccessfully built agents, they've hesitated putting them into production\nbecause they lack secure, scalable runtime services or memory or\nobservability, built specifically for agents. It's why we launched\nAgentCore, a set of infrastructure building blocks that allow builders to\ndeploy secure, scalable agents. Ericsson used AgentCore to deliver AI\nagents across their workforce, Sony used it to build a agentic AI platform\nwith enterprise-level security, observability, and scalability. And Cohere\nHealth is using AgentCore to deploy agents that will reduce medical review\ntimes by up to 30% to 40%. AgentCore's SDK has already been downloaded over\n1 million times, and our builders are excited about it. It's an enabler.\n\nCompanies will also use other agents, and AWS continues to build many of\nthe agents we believe builders will use in the future. For coding, we've\nrecently opened up our agentic coding IDE called Kiro. More than 100,000\ndevelopers jumped into Kiro in just the first few days of preview, and that\nnumber has more than doubled since. It's processed trillions of tokens thus\nfar, weekly actives are growing fast, and developers love its unique spec\nand tool calling capabilities. For migration and transformation, we offer\nan agent called Transform. Year-to-date, customers have already used it to\nsave 700,000 hours of manual effort, the equivalent of 335 developer years\nof work. For example, Thomson Reuters used it to transform 1.5 million\nlines of code per month, moving from Windows to open source alternatives\nand completing tasks or at times faster than with other migration tools.\n\nCustomers have also already used Transform to analyze nearly 1 billion\nlines of mainframe code as they move mainframe applications to the cloud.\nFor business customers, we've recently launched Quick Suite to bring a\nconsumer AI-like experience to work, making it easy to find insights,\nconduct deep research, automate tasks, visualize data, and take actions.\nWe've already seen users churn months-long projects into days, get 80% plus\ntime savings on complex tasks, and realize 90% plus cost savings. And for\ncontact centers, we offer Amazon Connect, which creates a more personalized\nand efficient experience for contact center agents, managers, and their\ncustomers. Connect has recently crested $1 billion annualized revenue run\nrate with 12 billion minutes of customer interactions being handled by AI\nin the last year and is being used by large enterprises like Capital One,\nToyota, American Airlines, and Ryanair. These are real practical results\nfor customers, and there are many more examples like them.\n\nBecause of its advantaged capabilities, security, operational performance,\nand customer focus, AWS continues to earn most of the big enterprise and\ngovernment transformations to the cloud. As a result, AWS is where the\npreponderance of company's data and workloads reside and part of why most\ncompanies want to run AI in AWS. To enable customers to do so, we need to\nhave the requisite capacity, and we've been focused on accelerating\ncapacity the last several months, adding more than 3.8 gigawatts of power\nin the past 12 months, more than any other cloud provider.\n\nTo put that into perspective, we're now double the power capacity that AWS\nwas in 2022, and we're on track to double again by 2027. In the last\nquarter of this year alone, we expect to add at least another 1 gigawatt of\npower. This capacity consists of power, data center, and chips, primarily\nour custom silicon, Trainium and NVIDIA. We've recently brought Project\nRainier online, our massive AI compute cluster spanning multiple U.S. data\ncenters and containing nearly 500,000 of our Trainium2 chips. Anthropic is\nusing it now to build and deploy its industry-leading AI model, Claude,\nwhich we expect to be on more than 1 million Trainium2 chips by year-end.\nTrainium2 continues to see strong adoption, is fully subscribed, and is now\na multibillion-dollar business that grew 150% quarter-over-quarter.\n\nToday, Trainium is being used by a small number of very large customers,\nbut we expect to accommodate more customers starting with Trainium3. We're\nbuilding Bedrock to be the biggest inference engine in the world and in the\nlong run, believe Bedrock could be as big a business for AWS as EC2, and\nthe majority of token usage in Amazon Bedrock is already running on\nTrainium. We're also continuing to work closely with chip partners like\nNVIDIA, with whom we continue to order very significant amounts as well as\nwith AMD and Intel. These are very important partners with whom we expect\nto keep growing our relationships over time.\n\nYou're going to see us continue to be very aggressive investing in capacity\nbecause we see the demand. As fast as we're adding capacity right now,\nwe're monetizing it. It's still quite early and represents an unusual\nopportunity for customers in AWS.\n\nI'll now turn to stores. Where the team continues to deliver and innovate\nfor customers across our key priorities, selection, low prices, and\nconvenience, particularly fast delivery, we're offering 14% more selection\nsince last quarter from popular brands like The North Face and Charlotte\nTilbury, and we've added hundreds of thousands of items from popular brands\nthis year. Everyday Essentials continues to grow quickly, and year-to-date\nis growing nearly twice as fast as the rest of the business. We continue to\nmake it easier for customers to order low-priced perishable groceries from\nAmazon, and customers in more than 1,000 cities and towns now can shop\nfresh groceries alongside millions of Amazon.com products with free same-\nday delivery. This is a game changer for customers who can now order milk\nalongside electronics, check out with one cart, and have everything\ndelivered to their doorstep within hours.\n\nThe team also invented a new Add to Delivery button that lets customers add\nitems to previously scheduled orders, and it's been used more than 80\nmillion times since launch, and it's just launched. It's an example of one\nof those seemingly simple but powerful innovations that make customers'\nlives easier. We remain committed to staying sharp on price and meeting or\nbeating prices of other major retailers. In July, we had our biggest Prime\nDay event ever, with customers saving billions of dollars across more than\n35 categories. We continue to break records on speed. We're on track to\ndeliver at our fastest speeds ever for Prime members globally once again\nthis year, and we've started rolling out 3-hour delivery in select U.S.\ncities.\n\nWe're also continuing to invest in infrastructure to speed up rural\ndeliveries and serve more customers in more communities. That includes\ncommitting over $4 billion to expand our rural delivery network across the\nU.S. These are small towns where people want fast delivery, but where other\ncompanies have been backing out and reducing service. In contrast, we've\nalready increased the number of rural communities with access to our same-\nday and next-day delivery by 60%, reaching roughly half of the total\ncommunities we plan to expand to by the end of the year.\n\nThe stores team is also innovating rapidly with AI. For example, Rufus, our\nAI-powered shopping assistant, has had 250 million active customers this\nyear with monthly users up 140% year-over-year, interactions up 210% year-\nover-year, and customers using Rufus during a shopping trip being 60% more\nlikely to complete a purchase. Rufus is on track to deliver over $10\nbillion in incremental annualized sales.\n\nHere are the highlights. Our generative AI-powered audio feature that\ncombines product summaries and reviews to make shopping easier has expanded\nfrom hundreds of products at launch to millions of products, and millions\nof customers have used it, streaming almost 3 million minutes. In Amazon\nLens, an AI-powered visual search tool that lets customers find products\nwith their phone's camera, a screenshot, or a barcode, now includes Lens\nLive, which instantly scans products and shows real-time matches in a\nswipeable carousel. Tens of millions of customers are using Amazon Lens\neach month.\n\nMoving on to Amazon Ads. We're pleased with the continued strong growth,\ngenerating $17.6 billion of revenue in the quarter and growing 22% year-\nover-year. We see strength across our broad portfolio of full photo\nadvertising offerings that helps advertisers reach an average ad-supported\naudience of more than 300 million in the U.S. alone. We also continue to be\nexcited about our demand-side platform, Amazon DSP, which lets advertisers\nplan, activate, and measure full-funnel investments.\n\nLast quarter, I mentioned our partnership with Roku, and we've built on\nthat with a partnership with Netflix, providing advertisers using Amazon\nDSP with direct access to Netflix's premium ad inventory. We announced\nintegrations with Spotify and SiriusXM. With Spotify, we provide\nadvertisers with direct programmatic access to a global audience of more\nthan 400 million monthly ad-supported listeners. And with SiriusXM, brands\ncan reach 160 million monthly digital listeners across services like\nPandora and SoundCloud, and we're excited about the advertising opportunity\naround Prime Video live sports. Live sports got a lot of interest from\nadvertisers in upfront negotiations for 2025, '26, and we exceeded our own\nexpectations for upfront commitments with significant growth across the\nboard.\n\nFinally, we're continuing to innovate for advertisers with AI. For example,\nin September, we announced an Agentic AI tool and creative studio that\nplans and executes the entire creative process in a matter of hours instead\nof weeks. We're also inventing and seeing strong momentum in several other\nareas, and I'll mention just a few. In Prime Video live sports, NBA on\nPrime tipped off last week, and our opening night doubleheader averaged\n1.25 million viewers in the U.S., a double-digit increase over last season\non cable. You'll see us bring the same constant innovation here that we\nbrought to our NFL broadcast. We're adding golf with The Masters in 2026\nand new skins competition with the PGA Tour on Black Friday this year. And\nwe've added Peacock and FOX One to Prime Video's add-on subscription\noffering of over 100 channels in the U.S.\n\nWe continue to be energized by the response to Alexa+ compared to what we\ncall the classic Alexa experience. Alexa+ customers are talking to Alexa 2x\nmore. Those interactions are much longer, and they're covering a broader\nrange of topics. So using Alexa+ and Fire TV at 2.5x the rate of classic,\nusing natural conversation to discover audio content 4x more, engaging with\nphotos 4x more, and customers are completing 4x more shopping conversations\nthat end in a purchase.\n\nWe've expanded the number of project hyper satellites in space to more than\n150 and delivered over 1 gigabit per second speeds and tests with our\nenterprise-grade customer terminal, the first commercial phased array we\nknow of to clear that threshold. Finally, Zoox robotaxis are available to\nriders in Las Vegas, and we've announced Washington D.C. as the eighth\ntesting location. We're excited for these to continue rolling out to more\nriders. Q4 is one of our busiest and most energizing times of the year, and\nwe're excited about the continued demand for AWS, the innovations we will\nannounce re:Invent in December, the positive customer response to our AI-\npowered experiences, all the guests will be delivering throughout the\nholiday season, and a lot more. Thanks in advance to our teammates around\nthe world who are gearing up to deliver for customers once again.\n\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update.\n\nBrian T. Olsavsky\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Andy. Starting with our top-line financial results. Worldwide\nrevenue was $180.2 billion, a 12% increase year-over-year, excluding a 90\nbasis point favorable impact of foreign exchange. In Q3, we reported\nworldwide operating income of $17.4 billion. This operating income includes\n2 special charges, which reduced operating income by $4.3 billion. The\nfirst charge of $2.5 billion is related to a legal settlement with the\nFederal Trade Commission, which impacts the North America segment and is\nrecorded in the other operating expense line.\n\nThe second charge of $1.8 billion relates to severance costs for role\neliminations and impacts all 3 of our segments. This severance charge is\nrecorded primarily in the technology and infrastructure, sales and\nmarketing, and general and administrative expense line items. Excluding\nthese 2 charges, worldwide operating income would have been $21.7 billion\nor $1.2 billion above the high end of our guidance range.\n\nMoving to our segment results. We remain encouraged by the innovation our\nteams are delivering for customers across all 3 segments. In the North\nAmerica segment, third quarter revenue was $106.3 billion, an increase of\n11% year-over-year. International segment revenue was $40.9 billion, an\nincrease of 10% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.\nWorldwide paid units grew 11% year-over-year. We continue to prioritize the\ninputs that matter most to our customers. In the third quarter, our sharp\npricing, broad selection, and fast delivery speeds continue to resonate\nwith customers. Customers appreciate the ability to quickly receive items\nessential for their daily needs, including perishable groceries, and have\nthem delivered in the same day. Our millions of global third-party sellers\ncontinue to be important contributors to our vast selection, which helps\ncustomers find the items they need at competitive prices.\n\nWe're committed to building innovative services and features for our\nsellers, including our ongoing advancements in generative AI. Today, more\nthan 1.3 million sellers have used our generative AI capabilities to more\nquickly launch high-quality listings. Better listings translate into better\ntraction with customers. And in Q3, worldwide third-party seller unit mix\nwas 62%, up 200 basis points from Q3 of last year.\n\nShifting to profitability. North America segment operating income was $4.8\nbillion, with an operating margin of 4.5%. Excluding the $2.5 billion\ncharge related to the legal settlement with the FTC, North America segment\noperating income would have been $7.3 billion with an operating margin of\n6.9%. North America segment operating margin also includes a portion of the\nseverance charge. International segment operating income was $1.2 billion,\nwith an operating margin of 2.9%. Excluding the impact of the severance\ncharge, International segment operating margins expanded year-over-year.\n\nGlobally, our progress on key inputs is delivering a better customer\nexperience while driving a more efficient cost structure. For example,\nwe're making notable strides in improving inventory placement to speed up\ndelivery to customers. And as a result, for the third year in a row, we are\non track to deliver our fastest speeds ever for Prime members in 2025. We\ncontinue to tune and improve our fulfillment operations, and our\nregionalized network is operating at scale. We see many benefits from our\ninbound process improvements, including a reduction of U.S. inbound lead\ntime by nearly 4 days compared to last year. This allows us to be more\nefficient with our inventory purchasing, which benefits working capital.\nWe're also placing inventory more strategically throughout the network. And\nby leveraging our existing infrastructure, we're now offering U.S.\ncustomers the ability to order perishable groceries and receive them the\nsame day in as little as 5 hours.\n\nWe're seeing positive early results since launching in January when\ncustomers start shopping fresh groceries on Amazon, they are visiting the\nsite more often and returning twice as often as nonperishable shoppers.\nLooking ahead, we see further opportunity to improve productivity in our\nglobal fulfillment and transportation network. We will continue to improve\ninventory placement to drive down distance traveled and touches per\npackage. We will also build on the gains from our regionalized network\nthrough algorithmic improvements as well as launching robotics and\nautomation. Operating margin may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, we have a\ndeliberate approach to achieve sustained progress over the long term.\n\nShifting to advertising. Advertising revenue was $17.7 billion, and growth\naccelerated for the third consecutive quarter. We continue to see strong\ngrowth on an increasingly large base, as our full funnel advertising\napproach of connecting brands with customers is resonating.\n\nMoving next to our AWS segment. Revenue was $33 billion, up 20.2% year-over-\nyear. This is an acceleration of 270 basis points compared to last quarter,\ndriven by strong growth across both our AI and core services and more\ncapacity, which has come online to support customer demand. AWS revenue\nincreased $2.1 billion quarter-over-quarter and now has an annualized\nrevenue run rate of $132 billion. AWS operating income was $11.4 billion\nand reflects our continued growth, coupled with our focus on driving\nefficiencies across the business.\n\nWe are expanding our data center footprint, largely to accommodate Gen AI.\nAnd to the extent those assets were placed into service, the related\ndepreciation does impact our margins. As we've long said, we expect AWS\noperating margins to fluctuate over time, driven in part by the level of\ninvestments we're making at any point in time.\n\nNow turning to our cash CapEx, which was $34.2 billion in Q3. We've now\nspent $89.9 billion so far this year. This primarily relates to AWS as we\ninvest to support demand for our AI and core services and in custom\nsilicon, like Trainium, as well as tech infrastructure to support our North\nAmerica and International segments. We'll continue to make significant\ninvestments, especially in AI, as we believe it to be a massive opportunity\nwith the potential for strong returns on invested capital over the long\nterm.\n\nAdditionally, we continue to invest in our fulfillment and transportation\nnetwork to support the growth of the business, improve delivery speeds, and\nlower our cost to serve. These investments will support growth for many\nyears to come. Looking ahead, we expect our full year cash CapEx to be\napproximately $125 billion in 2025, and we expect that amount will increase\nin 2026.\n\nI'll finish up my remarks with net income. While we primarily focus our\ncomments on operating income, our third quarter net income of $21.2 billion\nincludes a pretax gain of $9.5 billion related to our investment in\nAnthropic. This investment activity is not related to Amazon's ongoing\noperations and is included in nonoperating income. We're encouraged by the\nstart of the peak season, and we are ready to serve customers in the coming\nmonths. I want to thank our teams across Amazon for their hard work as we\nget ready to delight customers during the holiday season. Our commitment to\nelevating the customer experience is the only reliable way to drive\nsustainable value for our shareholders.\nWith that, let's move on to your questions.",
  "qa_text": "Operator\n\n[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of\nJustin Post with Bank of America.\n\nJustin Post\nBofA Securities, Research Division\n\nI'll ask on AWS. Can you just kind of go through how you're feeling about\nyour capacity levels and how capacity constrained you are right now? And\nthen in your prepared remarks, you mentioned Trainium3 demand and maybe\nbroadening out your customer base. Can you talk about the demand you're\nseeing outside of your major customers for Trainium?\n\nAndrew R. Jassy\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nYes. On the capacity side, we brought in quite a bit of capacity, as I\nmentioned in my opening comments, 3.8 gigawatts of capacity in the last\nyear with another gigawatt plus coming in the fourth quarter, and we expect\nto double our overall capacity by the end of 2027. So we're bringing in\nquite a bit of capacity today; overall in the industry, maybe the\nbottleneck is power. I think at some point, it may move to chips, but we're\nbringing in quite a bit of capacity. And as fast as we're bringing in right\nnow, we are monetizing it.\n\nAnd then on the Trainium demand, outside of our major customers. So first\nof all, as I mentioned on Trainium2, it's really doing well. It's fully\nsubscribed on Trainium2. We have -- it's a multibillion-dollar business at\nthis point. It grew 150% quarter-over-quarter in revenue. And you see\nreally big projects at scale now, like our Project Rainier that we're doing\nwith Anthropic, where they're running their next version of -- they're\ntraining the next version of Claude on top of Trainium2 on 500,000\nTrainium2 chips going to 1 million Trainium2 chips by the end of the year.\n\nAs I mentioned, we have -- today, with Trainium2, we have a small number of\nvery large customers on it. But because Trainium is 30% to 40% more price\nperformant than other options out there, and because as customers, as they\nstart to contemplate broader scale of their production workloads, moving to\nbeing AI-focused and using inference, they badly care about price\nperformance. And so we have a lot of demand for Trainium. Trainium3 should\npreview at the end of this year with much fuller volumes coming in the\nbeginning of '26. We have a lot of customers, both very large, and I'll\ncall it, medium-sized who're quite interested in Trainium3.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan\nStanley.\n\nBrian Thomas Nowak\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\n\nCongrats on the quarter, guys. So maybe 2. One, Andy, sort of a\nphilosophical chip question. There's a lot of questions in the market about\nTrainium and sort of its positioning versus other third-party chips. So how\ndo you think about the key hurdles of Trainium3 needs to overcome to really\nmake Trainium adoption broader, to your point on the last question, and\ncontinue to drive Trainium as opposed to satisfying what could be broader\ndemand with third-party chips in the near term?\n\nAndrew R. Jassy\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nYes. Well, first of all, we're always going to have multiple chip options\nfor our customers. It's been true in every major technology building block\nor component that we've had in AWS. Really in the history of AWS, it's\nnever just one player that over a long period of time has the entire market\nsegment and then it can satisfy everybody's needs on every dimension. And\nso we have a very deep relationship with NVIDIA. We have for a very long\ntime. And we will for as long as I can foresee the future. We buy a lot of\nNVIDIA. We are not constrained in any way in buying NVIDIA, and I expect\nthat we'll continue to buy more NVIDIA both next year and in the future.\n\nBut we're different from most technology companies in that we have our own\nvery strong chip team, and this is our Annapurna team. And you saw it first\non the CPU side with what we built with Graviton, which is about 40% better\nprice performance than the other x86 processors, and you're seeing it again\non the custom silicon on the AI side with Trainium, which is about the same\namount of price performance benefit for customers relative to other GPU\noptions.\n\nAnd our customers to be able to use AI as expansively as they want. And\nremember, it's still relatively early days at this point. They're going to\nneed better price performance, and they care about it deeply. And so I\nmentioned earlier the momentum that Trainium2 has. And I think that for us,\nas we think about Trainium3, I expect Trainium3 will be about 40% better\nthan Trainium2, and Trainium2 is already very advantaged on price\nperformance.\n\nSo we have to, of course, deliver the chip. We have to deliver it in\nvolumes and deliver it quickly. And we have to continue to work on the\nsoftware ecosystem, which gets better all the time. And as we have more\nproof points like we have with Project Rainier with what Anthropic is doing\non Trainium2, it builds increasing credibility for Trainium, and I think\ncustomers are very bullish about it. I'm bullish about it as well.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\n\nDouglas Till Anmuth\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nI'll stick with basically the same topic, Andy. But can you just talk a\nlittle bit about the architecture of Project Rainier and how it's\ndifferentiated and what that means for customers and for AWS? And do you\nexpect Rainier to expand beyond Anthropic? And how do you replicate Rainier\nwith Trainium3 chips?\n\nAndrew R. Jassy\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nYes. I think what is compelling for Anthropic around Project Rainier is --\nreally is the Trainium2 chip, which -- we built a very -- first of all, we\nbuilt a very large cluster that they can use in a very expansive way. And\nit's not simple to be able to build a cluster that has 500,000 plus chips\ngoing to 1 million. That's an infrastructure feat that's hard to do at\nscale. And so some piece of it is the infrastructure capabilities that\nwe've built over a long period of time in AWS that is unusual in the\nindustry. But it's just also the performance of the chip and the price\nperformance, both of which matter.\n\nAnd I think that Project Rainier is something that is specific for\nAnthropic, but we have a lot of other customers who are interested in\nemploying large clusters of Trainium chips that we're going to hopefully\ngive them a chance to do so with Trainium3.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.\n\nMark Stephen F. Mahaney\nEvercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division\n\nI want to ask about 2 topics, groceries and then how to think about\nheadcount in the future. And on groceries, I want to -- the perishables, I\nthink last quarter, you talked about 70% or something of users had never\npurchased perishables from Amazon before. Just talk about whether you -- I\nthink you used the term, game changer, before. Does this mean that maybe we\ndon't -- you no longer need to Amazon Fresh stores? You always had this\nDVD, Delivery Van Density, advantage. And have you kind of reached a point\nyou think of scale and speed that you really can change people's habits and\nreally have them consider Amazon as one of their first grocery options? Do\nyou really feel like you're at that point?\n\nAnd then secondly, just on the headcount, some of the recent news. Just\ntalk to us about how you think about headcount going forward? Are you\nseeing -- is the level of efficiencies that you're getting from AI such\nthat you can keep headcount relatively flattish for the foreseeable future?\nJust talk about the pros and cons or the wins and losses in terms of that\nheadcount going forward.\n\nAndrew R. Jassy\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nYes. So I'll start with grocery, Mark. We have a very large grocery\nbusiness. If you look at our entire grocery business, if I don't even count\nWhole Foods Market and Fresh, in the last 12 months to over $100 billion of\ngross merchandising sales, which would make us a top 3 grocery in the U.S.\nA good chunk of it is a lot of the items that you'd find in the middle\naisle, so consumables and canned goods and pet food and health and beauty,\nvery significant and continues to grow at a very good clip.\n\nBut then we also have Whole Foods Market, which is the pioneer in organic\nfoods, which is also growing at a faster clip than most grocery companies\nwith an attractive trajectory on profitability, and we'll expand our Whole\nFoods physical presence over the coming years here. And I'm also very\nexcited about this new concept, daily shop that we have, which is a smaller\nversion of Whole Foods in urban settings, which we have 3 that we've\nlaunched that are off to very good starts that you should expect to see\nmore of as well.\n\nAnd we have always been -- as you referenced, we've talked a lot about\nhaving a larger mass physical presence. And we continue to experiment with\nvarious formats. But the one that we are most excited about is what you\nreferenced, which is the ability to provide perishable groceries with same-\nday deliveries. And if you think about how many of our customers are buying\nfrom us multiple times a week and who are buying things like shampoo or\ndetergent or paper cups or water, where the ability to add milk and eggs\nand yogurt and other perishables to their order and have it live in the\nsame shop in cart and then show up a few hours later is very compelling.\n\nAnd we started with a few markets about a year ago, and we were really\ntaken aback at the adoption, not just the number of people that started\nbuying perishables from us very quickly, but how often they came back\ndownstream to buy perishables and groceries from us in the future. And so\nwe've now expanded that to 1,000 cities around the U.S. and will be in\n2,300 by the end of the year. And it's really changing the trajectory and\nthe size of our grocery business.\n\nAnd I also believe that this many years tradition of the weekly stock-up,\ngrocery stock-up is changing. And I think we're a big part of that. And I\nthink there's a lot of potential there for the grocery side. It doesn't\nmean that we won't continue to experiment with other physical formats, but\nwe're on to something very significant with what we're doing with\nperishables from our same-day facilities.\n\nAnd then on your headcount question, what I would tell you is the\nannouncement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven,\nand it's not even really AI-driven, not right now, at least. It really --\nit's culture. And if you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size\nof businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of\nbusinesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had\nbefore, and you end up with a lot more layers.\n\nAnd when that happens, sometimes without realizing it, you can weaken the\nownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work and who\nown most of the 2-way door decisions, the ones that should be made quickly\nand right at the front line, and it can lead to slowing you down. As a\nleadership team, we are committed to operating like the world's largest\nstart-up. And that means removing layers. It means increasing the amount of\nownership that people have, and it means inventing and moving quickly.\n\nAnd I don't know if there's ever been a time in the history of Amazon or\nmaybe business in general with the technology transformation happening\nright now, where it's important to be lean, it's important to be flat, and\nit's important to move fast, and that's what we're going to do.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman\nSachs.\n\nEric James Sheridan\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\n\nWanted to know, Andy, if you could reflect on the opportunity that's\ncontinuing to present itself in terms of rolling out more robotics and\nautomation and the broader theme of physical AI across your operations? And\nhow should we be thinking about that as a driver of potential efficiencies,\nbut also as a driver of the ability to possibly reinvest back in the\nbusiness over the long term?\n\nAndrew R. Jassy\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nRobotics is a very substantial area of investment for us. We have over 1\nmillion robots in our fulfillment network at this point. And I would say\nthat while that's significant, we have a lot of invention in flight. So I\nexpect that we'll have more over a period of time. Robotics are very\nimportant for us and for our customers and for our teammates because they\nimprove safety, they boost productivity, they increase speed, and they let\nour human teammates focus on problem-solving and what they do best.\n\nAnd we expect that our people remain at the heart in the center of our\nfulfillment network as they have from when we first started working with\nrobotics. And we expect that over time, we will have a fulfillment network\nwhere robots and humans complement each other and work together. But I\nthink you're going to continue to see us invest very significantly in\nrobotics. It's going to help on the safety, the productivity, the speed,\nand ultimately some of the cost pieces, which will allow us to continue to\nimprove the customer experience.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with TD Cowen.\n\nJohn Ryan Blackledge\nTD Cowen, Research Division\n\nHow does Amazon think about agentic commerce going forward? And how do you\nthink Amazon will serve customers using agents to purchase goods on Amazon\nin the future?\n\nAndrew R. Jassy\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nI'm very excited about -- and as a business, we're very excited about in\nthe long term the prospect of agentic commerce. And it has a chance to be\ngood for customers; it has a chance to be really good for e-commerce. And I\nthink if you're -- if you know what you want to buy, there are a few\nexperiences that are better than coming to Amazon. But if you don't know\nwhat you want, it's -- physical store with a physical salesperson still has\nsome advantages. Obviously, lots of people do it on Amazon all the time.\nBut you very often want to ask questions and help -- get help narrowing\nwhat you're going to look for. And as you keep asking new questions, having\na whole bunch of different options presented to you.\n\nAnd I think AI and agentic commerce are going to change the experience\nonline where that experience where you're narrowing what you want when you\ndon't know is going to get better online than it even is in physical\nenvironments.\n\nNow we obviously have our own efforts here in agentic commerce. We have\nRufus, which I talked about in my opening comments, which is continuing to\nget better and better and used more broadly. And we have features like Buy\nfor Me, where we will surface on Amazon, even items that we don't stock\nthat other merchants have. And then if customers want us to go and buy it\nfor them on those merchants' websites, we will do that. And both of those\nhave been successful for us. But we're also having conversations with and\nexpect over time to partner with third-party agents. And I think that it\nreminds me in some ways of the beginning of search engines many years ago\nbeing sources of discovery for commerce. And you had to kind of figure out\nthe right way to work together.\n\nAnd today, search engines are a very small part of our referral traffic,\nand third-party agents are a very small subset of that. But I do think that\nwe will find ways to partner. We have to find a way, though, that makes the\ncustomer experience good. Right now, I would say the customer experience is\nnot. There's no personalization, there's no shopping history, the delivery\nestimates are frequently wrong, the prices are often wrong.\n\nSo we've got to find a way to make the customer experience better and have\nthe right exchange value. But I do think that the exciting part of this and\nthe promise is that AI and agentic commerce solutions are going to expand\nthe amount of shopping that happens online. And I think that's really good\nfor customers, and I think it's really good for Amazon because at the end\nof the day, you're going to buy from the outfit that allows you to have the\nbroadest selection, great value, and continues to deliver for you very\nquickly and reliably. And I think that bodes well for us.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our final question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird.\n\nColin Alan Sebastian\nRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\n\nI guess first on AWS, following up there. How much of this acceleration is\ndriven by core infrastructure versus AI workload monetization? And I think\npart of it is trying to understand how important newer services like\nAgentCore are becoming and bringing enterprises to AWS to build agents? And\nthen I guess, secondly, regarding the acceleration in advertising, if you\ncould potentially disaggregate the core advertising contribution versus DSP\nand Prime Video, that would be helpful as well.\n\nAndrew R. Jassy\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nI'll start on the AWS side. We are seeing -- we're really pleased with the\nresults from this quarter, 20% year-over-year on an annualized run rate of\n$132 billion is unusual. And we have momentum. You can see it. And we see\nthe growth in both our AI area, where we see it in inference. We see it in\ntraining. We see it in the use of our Trainium custom silicon. Bedrock\ncontinues to grow really quickly. SageMaker continues to grow quickly. And\nI think that the number of companies who are working on building agents is\nvery significant. I do believe that a lot of the value that companies will\nrealize over time in AI will come from agents.\n\nAnd I think that building agents today is still harder than it should be.\nYou need tools to make it easier, which is why we built Strands, which is\nan open-source capability that lets people build agents from any model that\nthey can imagine. But even more so, when you talk to enterprises or\ncompanies that care a lot about security and scale, they're starting to\nbuild agents, and they don't really feel like they've got -- they've had\nbuilding blocks that allow them to have the type of secure, scalable agents\nthat they need to bet their businesses and their customer experience and\ntheir data on.\n\nAnd that's why -- that was really the inspiration behind AgentCore was to\nbuild another set of primitive building blocks like we built in the early\ndays of AWS, where it was compute and storage and database. We defined a\nset of building blocks that you needed to be able to deploy agents securely\nand scalably that we provide in AgentCore. And then when we talk to our\ncustomers, it really resonates. There is not anything else like it, it's\nchanging their time frame and their receptivity to building agents, and\nit's very compelling for them.\n\nSo I do think the combination of what we're doing to enable agents to be\nbuilt and run securely and scalably, as well as some of the agents that\nwe're building ourselves that our customers are excited about, are\ncompelling for them. And I think the other place we see a lot of growth in\nAWS also is just the number of enterprises who are -- who have gotten back\nto moving from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud. And we continue to\nearn the lion's share of those transformations. And I look at the momentum\nwe have right now, and I believe that we can continue to grow at a clip\nlike this for a while.\n\nI think on the advertising side, that is also an area where I think\ncollectively, we feel very pleased about the progress. Every single one of\nour advertising offerings this quarter grew in a meaningful way. I think\nthere's a few things going on for us. We have what I think of as a pretty\nunusual full-funnel offering. And if you look at the top of the funnel,\nwhich typically tends to be awareness building and broad scale, to be able\nto use our own Prime Video and our live sports capabilities as well as\ngoing all the way down to the bottom of the funnel at point of sale being\nable to use sponsored products, that's -- most people don't have a full-\nfunnel offering as robust as that. And then when you layer on top of it,\nthe combination of the audience curation and development we can do, along\nwith the advantage measurement, it just all leads to a return on\nadvertising spend is very unusual.\n\nAnd I think there are multiple places where we can expect to continue to\ngrow. One is in our stores business. I still think if you look at the\nworldwide market segment share of retail, still 80% to 85% of it lives in\nphysical stores. And that equation is going to flip over time. And I think\nAI is going to only accelerate that. So I think we have an opportunity -- a\nsignificant opportunity still in our existing stores. And then I think\nvideo, we've only been at this for a little bit of time, but it's already a\nvery large amount of advertising revenue, and we're still relatively early\nstage.\n\nI think that will continue to be a big area of growth. And then as you\nreferenced, the amount -- their demand-side platform or Amazon DSP, that is\ngrowing really quickly as well. Some of it had to do with the fact that we\nhad some features. We always had a number of the core components people\nwanted around some of our properties, the measurement capabilities, Amazon\nMarketing Cloud, but we lacked some features for a while as we were\nbuilding out our DSP that customers told us mattered, and the team over the\nlast 20 months have closed those gaps in a very significant way so that now\npeople feel like our DSP is fully featured.\n\nAnd then you look at some of the partnerships that we've done, the Roku\npartnership gives us the largest connected TV footprint in the U.S. And you\nlayer on top of that, what we've recently done in providing our DSP\ncustomers the opportunity to integrate with the ad inventory in Netflix and\nSpotify and SiriusXM; it's powerful. And so we are growing very quickly on\nthe demand-side platform. So very optimistic about what we're doing there.\nWe've work to do, obviously, but I don't think we're close to being able to\ngrow there.\n\nOperatorThanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A\nreplay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least 3\nmonths. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to speaking\nwith you again next quarter.\nCopyright © 2025 by S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P\nGlobal Inc.

Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2024. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 30, 2025 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, tariff and trade policies, and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now I'll turn the call over to Andy.",

      "text": "President, CEO & Director Thanks, Dave. We saw strong growth across our business in Q3, and we're reporting $180.2 billion in revenue, up 12% year-over-year, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income was $17.4 billion, but would have been over $21 billion if not for 2 special Q3 expenses, $2.5 billion for an FTC settlement and $1.8 billion for estimated severance costs. Trailing 12-month free cash flow was $14.8 billion. I'll start with AWS. AWS is growing at a pace we haven't seen since 2022, reaccelerating to 20.2% year-over-year, our largest growth rate in 11 quarters. It's worth remembering that year-over-year percentage growth is a relative term. It's very different having 20% year-over-year growth on a $132 billion annualized run rate than to have a higher percentage growth rate on a meaningfully smaller annual revenue, which is the case with our competitors. Backlog grew to $200 billion by Q3 quarter end and doesn't include several unannounced new deals in October, which together are more than our total deal volume for all of Q3. AWS is gaining momentum. Customers want to be running their core and AI workloads in AWS given its stronger functionality, security, and operational performance, and the scale I see in front of us gives me significant confidence in what lies ahead. I'll share a little more detail on why. It starts with AWS having much broader infrastructure functionality. Start- ups, enterprises, and governments want to move their production workloads to the place that has the broadest and deepest array of capabilities. AWS has more services and deeper features within those services than anybody else and continues to innovate at a rapid clip. These are key building blocks for anything that customers want to create, and they're a big part of why Gartner has named AWS leader in its strategic cloud platform services Magic Quadrant for 15 consecutive years. We're bringing the same building block approach to AI. SageMaker makes it much simpler for companies to build and deploy their own foundation models. Bedrock gives customers leading selection of foundation models and superior price performance to deploy inference into their next-generation applications. A lot of the future value companies will get from AI will be in the form of agents. AWS is heavily investing in this area and well positioned to be a leader. Companies will both create their own agents and use agents from other companies. For those building their own, it's been harder to build than it should be. It's why we launched Strands to make it much easier to create agents from any foundation model that builders desire. For companies who successfully built agents, they've hesitated putting them into production because they lack secure, scalable runtime services or memory or observability, built specifically for agents. It's why we launched AgentCore, a set of infrastructure building blocks that allow builders to deploy secure, scalable agents. Ericsson used AgentCore to deliver AI agents across their workforce, Sony used it to build a agentic AI platform with enterprise-level security, observability, and scalability. And Cohere Health is using AgentCore to deploy agents that will reduce medical review times by up to 30% to 40%. AgentCore's SDK has already been downloaded over 1 million times, and our builders are excited about it. It's an enabler. Companies will also use other agents, and AWS continues to build many of the agents we believe builders will use in the future. For coding, we've recently opened up our agentic coding IDE called Kiro. More than 100,000 developers jumped into Kiro in just the first few days of preview, and that number has more than doubled since. It's processed trillions of tokens thus far, weekly actives are growing fast, and developers love its unique spec and tool calling capabilities. For migration and transformation, we offer an agent called Transform. Year-to-date, customers have already used it to save 700,000 hours of manual effort, the equivalent of 335 developer years of work. For example, Thomson Reuters used it to transform 1.5 million lines of code per month, moving from Windows to open source alternatives and completing tasks or at times faster than with other migration tools. Customers have also already used Transform to analyze nearly 1 billion lines of mainframe code as they move mainframe applications to the cloud. For business customers, we've recently launched Quick Suite to bring a consumer AI-like experience to work, making it easy to find insights, conduct deep research, automate tasks, visualize data, and take actions. We've already seen users churn months-long projects into days, get 80% plus time savings on complex tasks, and realize 90% plus cost savings. And for contact centers, we offer Amazon Connect, which creates a more personalized and efficient experience for contact center agents, managers, and their customers. Connect has recently crested $1 billion annualized revenue run rate with 12 billion minutes of customer interactions being handled by AI in the last year and is being used by large enterprises like Capital One, Toyota, American Airlines, and Ryanair. These are real practical results for customers, and there are many more examples like them. Because of its advantaged capabilities, security, operational performance, and customer focus, AWS continues to earn most of the big enterprise and government transformations to the cloud. As a result, AWS is where the preponderance of company's data and workloads reside and part of why most companies want to run AI in AWS. To enable customers to do so, we need to have the requisite capacity, and we've been focused on accelerating capacity the last several months, adding more than 3.8 gigawatts of power in the past 12 months, more than any other cloud provider. To put that into perspective, we're now double the power capacity that AWS was in 2022, and we're on track to double again by 2027. In the last quarter of this year alone, we expect to add at least another 1 gigawatt of power. This capacity consists of power, data center, and chips, primarily our custom silicon, Trainium and NVIDIA. We've recently brought Project Rainier online, our massive AI compute cluster spanning multiple U.S. data centers and containing nearly 500,000 of our Trainium2 chips. Anthropic is using it now to build and deploy its industry-leading AI model, Claude, which we expect to be on more than 1 million Trainium2 chips by year-end. Trainium2 continues to see strong adoption, is fully subscribed, and is now a multibillion-dollar business that grew 150% quarter-over-quarter. Today, Trainium is being used by a small number of very large customers, but we expect to accommodate more customers starting with Trainium3. We're building Bedrock to be the biggest inference engine in the world and in the long run, believe Bedrock could be as big a business for AWS as EC2, and the majority of token usage in Amazon Bedrock is already running on Trainium. We're also continuing to work closely with chip partners like NVIDIA, with whom we continue to order very significant amounts as well as with AMD and Intel. These are very important partners with whom we expect to keep growing our relationships over time. You're going to see us continue to be very aggressive investing in capacity because we see the demand. As fast as we're adding capacity right now, we're monetizing it. It's still quite early and represents an unusual opportunity for customers in AWS. I'll now turn to stores. Where the team continues to deliver and innovate for customers across our key priorities, selection, low prices, and convenience, particularly fast delivery, we're offering 14% more selection since last quarter from popular brands like The North Face and Charlotte Tilbury, and we've added hundreds of thousands of items from popular brands this year. Everyday Essentials continues to grow quickly, and year-to-date is growing nearly twice as fast as the rest of the business. We continue to make it easier for customers to order low-priced perishable groceries from Amazon, and customers in more than 1,000 cities and towns now can shop fresh groceries alongside millions of Amazon.com products with free same- day delivery. This is a game changer for customers who can now order milk alongside electronics, check out with one cart, and have everything delivered to their doorstep within hours. The team also invented a new Add to Delivery button that lets customers add items to previously scheduled orders, and it's been used more than 80 million times since launch, and it's just launched. It's an example of one of those seemingly simple but powerful innovations that make customers' lives easier. We remain committed to staying sharp on price and meeting or beating prices of other major retailers. In July, we had our biggest Prime Day event ever, with customers saving billions of dollars across more than 35 categories. We continue to break records on speed. We're on track to deliver at our fastest speeds ever for Prime members globally once again this year, and we've started rolling out 3-hour delivery in select U.S. cities. We're also continuing to invest in infrastructure to speed up rural deliveries and serve more customers in more communities. That includes committing over $4 billion to expand our rural delivery network across the U.S. These are small towns where people want fast delivery, but where other companies have been backing out and reducing service. In contrast, we've already increased the number of rural communities with access to our same- day and next-day delivery by 60%, reaching roughly half of the total communities we plan to expand to by the end of the year. The stores team is also innovating rapidly with AI. For example, Rufus, our AI-powered shopping assistant, has had 250 million active customers this year with monthly users up 140% year-over-year, interactions up 210% year- over-year, and customers using Rufus during a shopping trip being 60% more likely to complete a purchase. Rufus is on track to deliver over $10 billion in incremental annualized sales. Here are the highlights. Our generative AI-powered audio feature that combines product summaries and reviews to make shopping easier has expanded from hundreds of products at launch to millions of products, and millions of customers have used it, streaming almost 3 million minutes. In Amazon Lens, an AI-powered visual search tool that lets customers find products with their phone's camera, a screenshot, or a barcode, now includes Lens Live, which instantly scans products and shows real-time matches in a swipeable carousel. Tens of millions of customers are using Amazon Lens each month. Moving on to Amazon Ads. We're pleased with the continued strong growth, generating $17.6 billion of revenue in the quarter and growing 22% year- over-year. We see strength across our broad portfolio of full photo advertising offerings that helps advertisers reach an average ad-supported audience of more than 300 million in the U.S. alone. We also continue to be excited about our demand-side platform, Amazon DSP, which lets advertisers plan, activate, and measure full-funnel investments. Last quarter, I mentioned our partnership with Roku, and we've built on that with a partnership with Netflix, providing advertisers using Amazon DSP with direct access to Netflix's premium ad inventory. We announced integrations with Spotify and SiriusXM. With Spotify, we provide advertisers with direct programmatic access to a global audience of more than 400 million monthly ad-supported listeners. And with SiriusXM, brands can reach 160 million monthly digital listeners across services like Pandora and SoundCloud, and we're excited about the advertising opportunity around Prime Video live sports. Live sports got a lot of interest from advertisers in upfront negotiations for 2025, '26, and we exceeded our own expectations for upfront commitments with significant growth across the board. Finally, we're continuing to innovate for advertisers with AI. For example, in September, we announced an Agentic AI tool and creative studio that plans and executes the entire creative process in a matter of hours instead of weeks. We're also inventing and seeing strong momentum in several other areas, and I'll mention just a few. In Prime Video live sports, NBA on Prime tipped off last week, and our opening night doubleheader averaged 1.25 million viewers in the U.S., a double-digit increase over last season on cable. You'll see us bring the same constant innovation here that we brought to our NFL broadcast. We're adding golf with The Masters in 2026 and new skins competition with the PGA Tour on Black Friday this year. And we've added Peacock and FOX One to Prime Video's add-on subscription offering of over 100 channels in the U.S. We continue to be energized by the response to Alexa+ compared to what we call the classic Alexa experience. Alexa+ customers are talking to Alexa 2x more. Those interactions are much longer, and they're covering a broader range of topics. So using Alexa+ and Fire TV at 2.5x the rate of classic, using natural conversation to discover audio content 4x more, engaging with photos 4x more, and customers are completing 4x more shopping conversations that end in a purchase. We've expanded the number of project hyper satellites in space to more than 150 and delivered over 1 gigabit per second speeds and tests with our enterprise-grade customer terminal, the first commercial phased array we know of to clear that threshold. Finally, Zoox robotaxis are available to riders in Las Vegas, and we've announced Washington D.C. as the eighth testing location. We're excited for these to continue rolling out to more riders. Q4 is one of our busiest and most energizing times of the year, and we're excited about the continued demand for AWS, the innovations we will announce re:Invent in December, the positive customer response to our AI- powered experiences, all the guests will be delivering throughout the holiday season, and a lot more. Thanks in advance to our teammates around the world who are gearing up to deliver for customers once again. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update.",

      "speaker": "Brian T. Olsavsky",
      "role": "Senior VP & CFO",
      "text": "Senior VP & CFO Thanks, Andy. Starting with our top-line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $180.2 billion, a 12% increase year-over-year, excluding a 90 basis point favorable impact of foreign exchange. In Q3, we reported worldwide operating income of $17.4 billion. This operating income includes 2 special charges, which reduced operating income by $4.3 billion. The first charge of $2.5 billion is related to a legal settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, which impacts the North America segment and is recorded in the other operating expense line. The second charge of $1.8 billion relates to severance costs for role eliminations and impacts all 3 of our segments. This severance charge is recorded primarily in the technology and infrastructure, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expense line items. Excluding these 2 charges, worldwide operating income would have been $21.7 billion or $1.2 billion above the high end of our guidance range. Moving to our segment results. We remain encouraged by the innovation our teams are delivering for customers across all 3 segments. In the North America segment, third quarter revenue was $106.3 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year. International segment revenue was $40.9 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Worldwide paid units grew 11% year-over-year. We continue to prioritize the inputs that matter most to our customers. In the third quarter, our sharp pricing, broad selection, and fast delivery speeds continue to resonate with customers. Customers appreciate the ability to quickly receive items essential for their daily needs, including perishable groceries, and have them delivered in the same day. Our millions of global third-party sellers continue to be important contributors to our vast selection, which helps customers find the items they need at competitive prices. We're committed to building innovative services and features for our sellers, including our ongoing advancements in generative AI. Today, more than 1.3 million sellers have used our generative AI capabilities to more quickly launch high-quality listings. Better listings translate into better traction with customers. And in Q3, worldwide third-party seller unit mix was 62%, up 200 basis points from Q3 of last year. Shifting to profitability. North America segment operating income was $4.8 billion, with an operating margin of 4.5%. Excluding the $2.5 billion charge related to the legal settlement with the FTC, North America segment operating income would have been $7.3 billion with an operating margin of 6.9%. North America segment operating margin also includes a portion of the severance charge. International segment operating income was $1.2 billion, with an operating margin of 2.9%. Excluding the impact of the severance charge, International segment operating margins expanded year-over-year. Globally, our progress on key inputs is delivering a better customer experience while driving a more efficient cost structure. For example, we're making notable strides in improving inventory placement to speed up delivery to customers. And as a result, for the third year in a row, we are on track to deliver our fastest speeds ever for Prime members in 2025. We continue to tune and improve our fulfillment operations, and our regionalized network is operating at scale. We see many benefits from our inbound process improvements, including a reduction of U.S. inbound lead time by nearly 4 days compared to last year. This allows us to be more efficient with our inventory purchasing, which benefits working capital. We're also placing inventory more strategically throughout the network. And by leveraging our existing infrastructure, we're now offering U.S. customers the ability to order perishable groceries and receive them the same day in as little as 5 hours. We're seeing positive early results since launching in January when customers start shopping fresh groceries on Amazon, they are visiting the site more often and returning twice as often as nonperishable shoppers. Looking ahead, we see further opportunity to improve productivity in our global fulfillment and transportation network. We will continue to improve inventory placement to drive down distance traveled and touches per package. We will also build on the gains from our regionalized network through algorithmic improvements as well as launching robotics and automation. Operating margin may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, we have a deliberate approach to achieve sustained progress over the long term. Shifting to advertising. Advertising revenue was $17.7 billion, and growth accelerated for the third consecutive quarter. We continue to see strong growth on an increasingly large base, as our full funnel advertising approach of connecting brands with customers is resonating. Moving next to our AWS segment. Revenue was $33 billion, up 20.2% year-over- year. This is an acceleration of 270 basis points compared to last quarter, driven by strong growth across both our AI and core services and more capacity, which has come online to support customer demand. AWS revenue increased $2.1 billion quarter-over-quarter and now has an annualized revenue run rate of $132 billion. AWS operating income was $11.4 billion and reflects our continued growth, coupled with our focus on driving efficiencies across the business. We are expanding our data center footprint, largely to accommodate Gen AI. And to the extent those assets were placed into service, the related depreciation does impact our margins. As we've long said, we expect AWS operating margins to fluctuate over time, driven in part by the level of investments we're making at any point in time. Now turning to our cash CapEx, which was $34.2 billion in Q3. We've now spent $89.9 billion so far this year. This primarily relates to AWS as we invest to support demand for our AI and core services and in custom silicon, like Trainium, as well as tech infrastructure to support our North America and International segments. We'll continue to make significant investments, especially in AI, as we believe it to be a massive opportunity with the potential for strong returns on invested capital over the long term. Additionally, we continue to invest in our fulfillment and transportation network to support the growth of the business, improve delivery speeds, and lower our cost to serve. These investments will support growth for many years to come. Looking ahead, we expect our full year cash CapEx to be approximately $125 billion in 2025, and we expect that amount will increase in 2026. I'll finish up my remarks with net income. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, our third quarter net income of $21.2 billion includes a pretax gain of $9.5 billion related to our investment in Anthropic. This investment activity is not related to Amazon's ongoing operations and is included in nonoperating income. We're encouraged by the start of the peak season, and we are ready to serve customers in the coming months. I want to thank our teams across Amazon for their hard work as we get ready to delight customers during the holiday season. Our commitment to elevating the customer experience is the only reliable way to drive sustainable value for our shareholders. With that, let's move on to your questions. Question and Answer",

On the capacity side, we brought in quite a bit of capacity, as I mentioned in my opening comments, 3.8 gigawatts of capacity in the last year with another gigawatt plus coming in the fourth quarter, and we expect to double our overall capacity by the end of 2027. So we're bringing in quite a bit of capacity today; overall in the industry, maybe the bottleneck is power. I think at some point, it may move to chips, but we're bringing in quite a bit of capacity. And as fast as we're bringing in right now, we are monetizing it. And then on the Trainium demand, outside of our major customers. So first of all, as I mentioned on Trainium2, it's really doing well. It's fully subscribed on Trainium2. We have -- it's a multibillion-dollar business at this point. It grew 150% quarter-over-quarter in revenue. And you see really big projects at scale now, like our Project Rainier that we're doing with Anthropic, where they're running their next version of -- they're training the next version of Claude on top of Trainium2 on 500,000 Trainium2 chips going to 1 million Trainium2 chips by the end of the year. As I mentioned, we have -- today, with Trainium2, we have a small number of very large customers on it. But because Trainium is 30% to 40% more price performant than other options out there, and because as customers, as they start to contemplate broader scale of their production workloads, moving to being AI-focused and using inference, they badly care about price performance. And so we have a lot of demand for Trainium. Trainium3 should preview at the end of this year with much fuller volumes coming in the beginning of '26. We have a lot of customers, both very large, and I'll call it, medium-sized who're quite interested in Trainium3.",

There's a lot of questions in the market about Trainium and sort of its positioning versus other third-party chips. So how do you think about the key hurdles of Trainium3 needs to overcome to really make Trainium adoption broader, to your point on the last question, and continue to drive Trainium as opposed to satisfying what could be broader demand with third-party chips in the near term?",

      "text": "President, CEO & Director Yes. Well, first of all, we're always going to have multiple chip options for our customers. It's been true in every major technology building block or component that we've had in AWS. Really in the history of AWS, it's never just one player that over a long period of time has the entire market segment and then it can satisfy everybody's needs on every dimension. And so we have a very deep relationship with NVIDIA. We have for a very long time. And we will for as long as I can foresee the future. We buy a lot of NVIDIA. We are not constrained in any way in buying NVIDIA, and I expect that we'll continue to buy more NVIDIA both next year and in the future. But we're different from most technology companies in that we have our own very strong chip team, and this is our Annapurna team. And you saw it first on the CPU side with what we built with Graviton, which is about 40% better price performance than the other x86 processors, and you're seeing it again on the custom silicon on the AI side with Trainium, which is about the same amount of price performance benefit for customers relative to other GPU options. And our customers to be able to use AI as expansively as they want. And remember, it's still relatively early days at this point. They're going to need better price performance, and they care about it deeply. And so I mentioned earlier the momentum that Trainium2 has. And I think that for us, as we think about Trainium3, I expect Trainium3 will be about 40% better than Trainium2, and Trainium2 is already very advantaged on price performance. So we have to, of course, deliver the chip. We have to deliver it in volumes and deliver it quickly. And we have to continue to work on the software ecosystem, which gets better all the time. And as we have more proof points like we have with Project Rainier with what Anthropic is doing on Trainium2, it builds increasing credibility for Trainium, and I think customers are very bullish about it. I'm bullish about it as well.",

And it's not simple to be able to build a cluster that has 500,000 plus chips going to 1 million. That's an infrastructure feat that's hard to do at scale. And so some piece of it is the infrastructure capabilities that we've built over a long period of time in AWS that is unusual in the industry. But it's just also the performance of the chip and the price performance, both of which matter. And I think that Project Rainier is something that is specific for Anthropic, but we have a lot of other customers who are interested in employing large clusters of Trainium chips that we're going to hopefully give them a chance to do so with Trainium3.",

And have you kind of reached a point you think of scale and speed that you really can change people's habits and really have them consider Amazon as one of their first grocery options?

      "text": "President, CEO & Director Yes. So I'll start with grocery, Mark. We have a very large grocery business. If you look at our entire grocery business, if I don't even count Whole Foods Market and Fresh, in the last 12 months to over $100 billion of gross merchandising sales, which would make us a top 3 grocery in the U.S. A good chunk of it is a lot of the items that you'd find in the middle aisle, so consumables and canned goods and pet food and health and beauty, very significant and continues to grow at a very good clip. But then we also have Whole Foods Market, which is the pioneer in organic foods, which is also growing at a faster clip than most grocery companies with an attractive trajectory on profitability, and we'll expand our Whole Foods physical presence over the coming years here. And I'm also very excited about this new concept, daily shop that we have, which is a smaller version of Whole Foods in urban settings, which we have 3 that we've launched that are off to very good starts that you should expect to see more of as well. And we have always been -- as you referenced, we've talked a lot about having a larger mass physical presence. And we continue to experiment with various formats. But the one that we are most excited about is what you referenced, which is the ability to provide perishable groceries with same- day deliveries. And if you think about how many of our customers are buying from us multiple times a week and who are buying things like shampoo or detergent or paper cups or water, where the ability to add milk and eggs and yogurt and other perishables to their order and have it live in the same shop in cart and then show up a few hours later is very compelling. And we started with a few markets about a year ago, and we were really taken aback at the adoption, not just the number of people that started buying perishables from us very quickly, but how often they came back downstream to buy perishables and groceries from us in the future. And so we've now expanded that to 1,000 cities around the U.S. and will be in 2,300 by the end of the year. And it's really changing the trajectory and the size of our grocery business. And I also believe that this many years tradition of the weekly stock-up, grocery stock-up is changing. And I think we're a big part of that. And I think there's a lot of potential there for the grocery side. It doesn't mean that we won't continue to experiment with other physical formats, but we're on to something very significant with what we're doing with perishables from our same-day facilities. And then on your headcount question, what I would tell you is the announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now, at least. It really -- it's culture. And if you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size of businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers. And when that happens, sometimes without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work and who own most of the 2-way door decisions, the ones that should be made quickly and right at the front line, and it can lead to slowing you down. As a leadership team, we are committed to operating like the world's largest start-up. And that means removing layers. It means increasing the amount of ownership that people have, and it means inventing and moving quickly. And I don't know if there's ever been a time in the history of Amazon or maybe business in general with the technology transformation happening right now, where it's important to be lean, it's important to be flat, and it's important to move fast, and that's what we're going to do.",

And it has a chance to be good for customers; it has a chance to be really good for e-commerce. And I think if you're -- if you know what you want to buy, there are a few experiences that are better than coming to Amazon. But if you don't know what you want, it's -- physical store with a physical salesperson still has some advantages. Obviously, lots of people do it on Amazon all the time. But you very often want to ask questions and help -- get help narrowing what you're going to look for. And as you keep asking new questions, having a whole bunch of different options presented to you. And I think AI and agentic commerce are going to change the experience online where that experience where you're narrowing what you want when you don't know is going to get better online than it even is in physical environments. Now we obviously have our own efforts here in agentic commerce. We have Rufus, which I talked about in my opening comments, which is continuing to get better and better and used more broadly. And we have features like Buy for Me, where we will surface on Amazon, even items that we don't stock that other merchants have. And then if customers want us to go and buy it for them on those merchants' websites, we will do that. And both of those have been successful for us. But we're also having conversations with and expect over time to partner with third-party agents. And I think that it reminds me in some ways of the beginning of search engines many years ago being sources of discovery for commerce. And you had to kind of figure out the right way to work together. And today, search engines are a very small part of our referral traffic, and third-party agents are a very small subset of that. But I do think that we will find ways to partner. We have to find a way, though, that makes the customer experience good. Right now, I would say the customer experience is not. There's no personalization, there's no shopping history, the delivery estimates are frequently wrong, the prices are often wrong. So we've got to find a way to make the customer experience better and have the right exchange value. But I do think that the exciting part of this and the promise is that AI and agentic commerce solutions are going to expand the amount of shopping that happens online. And I think that's really good for customers, and I think it's really good for Amazon because at the end of the day, you're going to buy from the outfit that allows you to have the broadest selection, great value, and continues to deliver for you very quickly and reliably.

      "text": "President, CEO & Director I'll start on the AWS side. We are seeing -- we're really pleased with the results from this quarter, 20% year-over-year on an annualized run rate of $132 billion is unusual. And we have momentum. You can see it. And we see the growth in both our AI area, where we see it in inference. We see it in training. We see it in the use of our Trainium custom silicon. Bedrock continues to grow really quickly. SageMaker continues to grow quickly. And I think that the number of companies who are working on building agents is very significant. I do believe that a lot of the value that companies will realize over time in AI will come from agents. And I think that building agents today is still harder than it should be. You need tools to make it easier, which is why we built Strands, which is an open-source capability that lets people build agents from any model that they can imagine. But even more so, when you talk to enterprises or companies that care a lot about security and scale, they're starting to build agents, and they don't really feel like they've got -- they've had building blocks that allow them to have the type of secure, scalable agents that they need to bet their businesses and their customer experience and their data on. And that's why -- that was really the inspiration behind AgentCore was to build another set of primitive building blocks like we built in the early days of AWS, where it was compute and storage and database. We defined a set of building blocks that you needed to be able to deploy agents securely and scalably that we provide in AgentCore. And then when we talk to our customers, it really resonates. There is not anything else like it, it's changing their time frame and their receptivity to building agents, and it's very compelling for them. So I do think the combination of what we're doing to enable agents to be built and run securely and scalably, as well as some of the agents that we're building ourselves that our customers are excited about, are compelling for them. And I think the other place we see a lot of growth in AWS also is just the number of enterprises who are -- who have gotten back to moving from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud. And we continue to earn the lion's share of those transformations. And I look at the momentum we have right now, and I believe that we can continue to grow at a clip like this for a while. I think on the advertising side, that is also an area where I think collectively, we feel very pleased about the progress. Every single one of our advertising offerings this quarter grew in a meaningful way. I think there's a few things going on for us. We have what I think of as a pretty unusual full-funnel offering. And if you look at the top of the funnel, which typically tends to be awareness building and broad scale, to be able to use our own Prime Video and our live sports capabilities as well as going all the way down to the bottom of the funnel at point of sale being able to use sponsored products, that's -- most people don't have a full- funnel offering as robust as that. And then when you layer on top of it, the combination of the audience curation and development we can do, along with the advantage measurement, it just all leads to a return on advertising spend is very unusual. And I think there are multiple places where we can expect to continue to grow. One is in our stores business. I still think if you look at the worldwide market segment share of retail, still 80% to 85% of it lives in physical stores. And that equation is going to flip over time. And I think AI is going to only accelerate that. So I think we have an opportunity -- a significant opportunity still in our existing stores. And then I think video, we've only been at this for a little bit of time, but it's already a very large amount of advertising revenue, and we're still relatively early stage. I think that will continue to be a big area of growth. And then as you referenced, the amount -- their demand-side platform or Amazon DSP, that is growing really quickly as well. Some of it had to do with the fact that we had some features. We always had a number of the core components people wanted around some of our properties, the measurement capabilities, Amazon Marketing Cloud, but we lacked some features for a while as we were building out our DSP that customers told us mattered, and the team over the last 20 months have closed those gaps in a very significant way so that now people feel like our DSP is fully featured. And then you look at some of the partnerships that we've done, the Roku partnership gives us the largest connected TV footprint in the U.S. And you layer on top of that, what we've recently done in providing our DSP customers the opportunity to integrate with the ad inventory in Netflix and Spotify and SiriusXM; it's powerful. And so we are growing very quickly on the demand-side platform. So very optimistic about what we're doing there. We've work to do, obviously, but I don't think we're close to being able to grow there. OperatorThanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions.
