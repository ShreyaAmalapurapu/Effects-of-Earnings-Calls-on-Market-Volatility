Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the\ncall. Today, Apple is proud to report $102.5 billion in revenue, up 8% from\na year ago and a September quarter record. Services achieved an all-time\nrevenue record of $28.8 billion, growing 15% from a year ago. EPS came in\nat $1.85, setting a September quarter record. We grew in the vast majority\nof markets we track and had September quarter revenue records in dozens of\nmarkets, including the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, the\nMiddle East, Japan, Korea and South Asia. We also set a September quarter\nrevenue record in emerging markets and an all-time revenue record in India.\nThese results come at the close of an extraordinary year for Apple in which\nwe achieved an all-time revenue record of $416 billion for the fiscal year.\n\n\n\nWe set all-time revenue records in emerging and developed markets. We set\nan all-time revenue record for iPhone. And in Services, we achieved all-\ntime records across every geographic segment. These results reflect the\ntremendous customer enthusiasm for Apple products and services as well as\nour deep commitment to innovation. We are incredibly excited about the\nstrength we're seeing across our products and services, and we expect the\nDecember quarter's revenue to be the best ever for the company and the best\never for iPhone.\n\n\nWe are heading into the holiday season with a truly remarkable lineup. That\nincludes the biggest leap ever for iPhone, which has had a tremendous\nresponse from our users around the world. Our Apple Watch lineup is more\ncapable than ever, too, giving users ways to take charge of their health\nlike never before through new features like hypertension notifications and\nsleep score. And the next-level sound quality and active noise cancellation\nof AirPods Pro 3 are hitting all the right notes for our users.\n\n\nIn October, we also broke new ground in power-efficient performance with\nthe uncomparably fast M5 chip packed with neural accelerators in each GPU\ncore to supercharge AI workflows. iPad Pro combines game-changing features\non iPadOS 26 with the power of M5 to create our most capable iPad ever. At\nthe same time, the M5 MacBook Pro raises the bar for what users can do with\na laptop while the new M5 -- powered Apple Vision Pro opens up amazing\npossibilities on its infinite canvas.\n\n\nWe also launched a beautiful new software design that creates a unified\nexperience across all of our platforms for the very first time. The design\nis crafted with a new material called Liquid Glass that brings fluidity,\nvitality and flexibility to our products. Along with the new design, we\ndelivered powerful new features to enable users to do even more with their\ndevices. That includes updates to the Phone and messages apps in iOS 26 to\nhelp users stay connected, continuity enhancements in Mac to deliver an\neven more seamless experience across devices and a powerful new windowing\nsystem that fundamentally transforms the user experience on iPadOS 26.\n\n\nAs we continue to expand our investment in AI, we're bringing intelligence\nto more of what people already love about our products and services, making\nevery experience even more personal, capable and effortless. At the heart\nof it all is Apple silicon, and we were thrilled to launch new products\npowered by the A19 Pro chip and M5. These incredibly advanced chips make\nApple products the very best place to experience the power of AI.\n\n\nWith Apple Intelligence, we've introduced dozens of new features that are\npowerful, intuitive, private and deeply integrated into the things people\ndo every day, features like Live Translation, which help users communicate\nacross languages in real time; and visual intelligence, which opens new\nways to learn about and explore the world. We also introduced Workout\nBuddy, a new experience that uses AI to provide personalized motivational\ninsights based on a user's workout data and fitness history.\n\n\nAnd these joined so many others from Clean Up in photos and new image\ncreation tools to powerful writing tools. We're also seeing developers take\nadvantage of our own device foundation models to create entirely new\nexperiences for users around the world. We're also excited for our more\npersonalized Siri. We're making good progress on it, and as we've shared,\nwe expect to release it next year.\n\n\nNow let's take a closer look at the September quarter results across our\nlineup, starting with iPhone. iPhone set a revenue record for the September\nquarter at $49 billion, up 6% from a year ago, with growth in the vast\nmajority of markets we track despite supply constraints we faced on several\niPhone 16 and iPhone 17 models given strong demand. Redesigned from the\ninside out and powered by the outstanding A19 Pro chip, the iPhone 17 Pro\nis by far the most powerful iPhone we've ever made, setting a whole new\nstandard for the smartphone industry. The iPhone 17 Pro also offers our\nbest camera system ever with an all-new 8x telephoto camera and looks\nstunning with bold new finishes like Cosmic Orange. The iPhone Air\nintroduces an incredibly breakthrough design and with a bigger and brighter\ndisplay with ProMotion, the iPhone 17 is a fantastic upgrade packed with\nfeatures users will love.\n\n\nIn Mac, we had a strong September quarter with revenue of $8.7 billion, up\n13% year-over-year driven by the strength of the MacBook Air. The MacBook\nAir enables users to get things done easily on the world's most popular\nlaptop. Mac mini users are loving how much performance is packed into our\nsmallest Mac ever made, while Mac Studio customers are pushing the envelope\nof what's possible with our most powerful Mac ever. And the latest 14-inch\nMacBook Pro unlocks incredible speed and next-level performance with the\nall-new M5 chip, which delivers 3.5x faster AI performance than M4.\n\n\nTurning to iPad. Revenue was $7 billion for the September quarter. Last\nmonth, we released one of the most attention grabbing software updates\nwe've had in years with iPadOS 26 and we recently gave iPad users even more\nto love with the launch of the incredible M5 iPad Pro, which offers an\nincredible boost in AI performance. With an unmatched combination of power\nand versatility, the new iPad Pro makes every interaction delightful with\nits thin, light and portable design.\n\n\nIn Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue was $9 billion. As I mentioned\nearlier, we were excited to unlock new possibilities for users with the\nlaunch of our newest Apple Watch lineup, making the world's most popular\nwatch even better. That includes Apple Watch Ultra 3 with the largest\ndisplay ever in an Apple Watch, improved battery life and emergency SOS via\nsatellite. Apple Watch Series 11 brings our users the most comprehensive\nset of health features yet. And Apple Watch SE 3 delivers advanced\ncapabilities at an incredible value.\n\n\nAI and advanced machine learning are at the core of powerful health\nfeatures like heart rate monitoring, fall detection, crash detection and\nmore. With our latest Apple Watch lineup, we were proud to introduce\nhypertension notifications, developed using large-scale machine learning\nmodels. Hypertension is one of the leading risk factors for heart attack\nand stroke affecting more than 1 billion adults worldwide, and we expect to\nnotify more than 1 million users of this life-threatening condition. We're\nalso excited about sleep score, a simple, intuitive way to help users\nbetter understand their sleep quality and discover ways to improve it.\nThat's something I'm sure we can all benefit from.\n\n\nMeanwhile, AirPods Pro 3 have been a huge hit. You have to hear them to\nreally understand just how remarkable they are. users and reviewers alike\nare praising their incredible sound quality and improved fit. They feature\nthe world's best in-ear active noise cancellation, removing up to 2x as\nmuch noise as the previous generation. And with Live Translation powered by\nApple Intelligence, AirPods deliver an incredibly new and exciting\nexperience for users around the world.\n\n\nTurning to Services. As I mentioned earlier, revenue was $28.8 billion for\nthe September quarter, 15% higher year-over-year and an all-time record. We\nsaw double-digit growth in both developed and emerging markets and set new\nall-time records across advertising, App Store, cloud services, Music,\npayment services and video.\n\n\nApple TV celebrated a big night at this year's Emmy Awards with 22 wins.\nThe studio led the night with 13 wins, the most of any comedy series in\nEmmy's history. Severance topped all dramas with 8 wins, adding to the\naccolades for this landmark series. To date, Apple TV productions have now\nearned over 600 wins and 2,800 nominations in total, driven by powerful\noriginal storytelling. And we're excited for audiences to discover new\nproductions like Pluribus and to catch returning favorites like Slow Horses\nand The Morning Show.\n\n\nAnd soon, Apple TV will be the destination for F1 fans across the U.S. on\ntrack day, thanks to a new partnership with Formula 1. F1 is one of the\nmost exciting and fastest-growing sports in the world, and starting next\nyear, Apple TV will be the place for subscribers to follow every twist and\nturn of the new season. And in addition, F1, the movie, one of the year's\nbiggest blockbusters, will be coming to Apple TV on December 12.\n\n\nDuring the September quarter, we also marked the 10-year anniversary of\nApple News. Apple News provides access to front page news from all around\nthe world, putting hundreds of publications right at users' fingertips.\n\n\nTurning to retail. We're heading into our busiest time of year with our\nbest ever lineup. In the last few months, we've opened new stores in\nemerging markets like India and the UAE and new locations in the U.S. and\nChina. I was also in Tokyo last month for the opening of the redesigned and\nreimagined Apple Ginza store, and the energy among the crowd was truly\nremarkable. When it originally opened, it was our first store outside the\nUnited States, and so it was especially meaningful to come back to welcome\ncustomers to the beautiful new space.\n\n\nEverywhere we operate and in everything we do, we strive to give the best\nto our users while living by our values, whether that's building new\naccessibility features into our most recent software releases or advancing\nour environmental work by using even more recycled materials in our latest\nlineup or providing free educational programming to train and support\nAmerican businesses with our new Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit.\nAnd we're continuing to invest in innovation and user experiences that will\ntransform our future.\n\n\nA great example is the work we're doing in the U.S. where we're committed\nto invest $600 billion over the next 4 years with a focus on innovation in\nstrategic areas like advanced manufacturing, silicon engineering and\nartificial intelligence. These commitments build on our long-standing\ninvestments in America while supporting more than 450,000 jobs with\nthousands of suppliers across all 50 states. We built a new factory in\nHouston for advanced AI service, for example, which just started shipping\nits first products off the line, and we're leading the creation of end-to-\nend silicon supply chain across the country.\n\n\nIn recent months, I've connected with developers, innovators, artists,\nentrepreneurs and so many others around the world, people passionate about\ninnovation and all the things they can do with Apple products. Each one is\nanother reminder of why we do what we do. We're driven to empower people to\ndo more of the things that matter most to them and enrich their lives along\nthe way. As we head into the holiday season with our most powerful lineup\never, I couldn't be more excited for what's to come.\n\n\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Kevan.\n\n\nKevan  Parekh\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Our revenue of $102.5 billion\nwas up 8% year-over-year and is a new September quarter record. We set\nSeptember quarter records in the Americas, Europe, Japan and the rest of\nAsia Pacific and grew in the vast majority of markets we track. Products\nrevenue was $73.7 billion, up 5% year-over-year, driven by growth across\niPhone and Mac and reached a September quarter record. Thanks to our\nexceptional customer satisfaction and strong levels of loyalty, our\ninstalled base of active devices has reached another all-time high across\nall product categories and geographic segments. Services revenue was $28.8\nbillion, up 15% year-over-year and an all-time record. The performance was\nbroad-based, with double-digit growth in the vast majority of the markets\nwe track and double-digit growth across most of our Services categories.\n\n\nCompany gross margin was 47.2%, above the high end of our guidance range\nand up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by favorable mix. This includes\napproximately $1.1 billion of tariff-related costs, which is in line with\nwhat we had estimated on our last call. Products gross margin was 36.2%, up\n170 basis points sequentially driven by favorable mix. Services gross\nmargin was 75.3%, down 30 basis points sequentially. Operating expenses\nlanded at $15.9 billion, up 11% year-over-year, driven by increased\ninvestment in R&D. These strong levels of business performance led to\nSeptember quarter records for both net income and diluted earnings per\nshare.\n\n\nNet income was $27.5 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $1.85, up\n13% year-over-year on an adjusted basis, excluding the onetime charge we\nrecognized during the fourth quarter of 2024. Operating cash flow was also\na September quarter record at $29.7 billion.\n\n\nNow I'm going to provide some more details for each of our revenue\ncategories. iPhone revenue was $49 billion, up 6% year-over-year, driven by\nthe iPhone 16 family. iPhone grew in the vast majority of the markets we\ntrack with September quarter records in many emerging markets, including\nLatin America, the Middle East and South Asia and an all-time record in\nIndia. The iPhone active installed base grew to an all-time high, and we\nset a September quarter record for upgraders.\n\n\nAccording to the recent survey from Worldpanel, iPhone was the top-selling\nmodel in the U.S., urban China, the U.K., France, Australia and Japan. We\ncontinue to see very high levels of customer satisfaction in the U.S. at\n98% as measured by 451 Research. Mac revenue was $8.7 billion, up 13% year-\nover-year, driven by MacBook Air. We grew in every geographic segment with\nstrong double-digit growth in emerging markets. The Mac installed base\nreached another all-time high with nearly half of customers who purchased a\nMac being new to the product. And the latest customer satisfaction for Mac\nin the U.S. was reported at 96%.\n\n\niPad revenue was $7 billion, flat year-over-year. Keep in mind, we faced a\ndifficult compare against the full quarter impact of the iPad Air and iPad\nPro launch from last year, offset by the better-than-expected performance\non the iPad. The installed base reached an all-time high with a September\nquarter record for upgraders and over half of the customers who purchased\nan iPad during the quarter were new to the product. Based on the latest\nreports from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 98% in the U.S.\n\n\nWearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $9 billion, flat year-over-\nyear. This was driven by growth on Watch and AirPods, offset by\naccessories, which was impacted by strong performance in the year ago\nquarter, driven by the iPad launches. Both the Apple Watch and AirPods\ninstalled bases reached new all-time highs. Over half of the customers\npurchasing Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product, and we\nalso set a September record for upgraders on Apple Watch. And in the U.S.,\ncustomer satisfaction was recently measured at 95%.\n\n\nOur Services revenue reached an all-time high of $28.8 billion, up 15% year-\nover-year. We achieved all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe,\nJapan and rest of Asia Pacific as well as a September quarter record in\nGreater China.\n\n\nThe majority of categories saw a sequential acceleration, and as Tim\nmentioned, we set many all-time revenue records, including payment\nservices, where we reached an all-time revenue record and saw a double-\ndigit growth year-over-year on Apple Pay active users. This strong momentum\nin the September quarter drove our total fiscal year services revenue to\nsurpass $100 billion, up 14% year-over-year and our best ever. The growth\nof our installed base of active devices continues to offer us great\nopportunities for the future.\n\n\nCustomer engagement across our services offerings also continue to grow.\nBoth transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs, and we\ncontinue to improve the quality and expand the reach of our services\nofferings. From additional markets for Apple Pay, now available in nearly\n90 countries, to AppleCare One, a great new way to cover multiple Apple\nproducts in a single plan.\n\n\nTurning to enterprise. We are seeing an adoption of Apple products\naccelerate across industries to improve productivity and drive innovation.\nThe BMW Group has been deploying tens of thousands of iPhones, including\nthe factory employees to further strengthen its digital capabilities and\nadvance innovation at the company. Capital One has expanded its Mac choice\nprogram by adding thousands more MacBook Airs across its workforce.\n\n\nIn the Czech Republic, its largest bank, Ceska sporitelna, continues to\ninvest in the Apple ecosystem with over 5,000 iPhones in addition to its\nexisting thousands of iPads and Macs. And Purdue University has launched a\nspatial computing hub built around Vision Pro, designed to help prepare\nstudents to lead the next wave of innovation in critical industries like\nsemiconductor and pharmaceutical manufacturing.\n\n\nLet's turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the\nquarter with $132 billion in cash and marketable securities. We had $1.3\nbillion of debt maturities and decreased commercial paper by $1.9 billion,\nresulting in $99 billion in total debt. Therefore, at the end of the\nquarter, net cash was $34 billion.\n\n\nDuring the quarter, we returned $24 billion to shareholders. This included\n$3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $20 billion through open\nmarket repurchases of 89 million Apple shares.\n\n\nTaking a step back, we are very pleased with our record fiscal year 2025\nresults. As Tim mentioned, total company revenue for the year was $416\nbillion with growth in iPhone, Mac, iPad and Services and all-time records\nin the vast majority of markets we track. This revenue performance led to\nvery strong full year operating results with all-time records for net\nincome and for diluted EPS, which grew double digits year-over-year on an\nadjusted basis.\n\n\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook,\nwhich includes the types of forward-looking information Suhasini referred\nto. Importantly, the color we're providing assumes that the global tariff\nrates, policies and application remain in effect as of this call and the\nglobal macroeconomic outlook does not worsen from today. We expect our\nDecember quarter total company revenue to grow by 10% to 12% year-over-\nyear, which will be our best quarter ever.\n\n\nWe expect iPhone revenue to grow double digits year-over-year, which would\nbe our best iPhone quarter ever. On Mac, keep in mind, we expect to face a\nvery difficult compare against the M4 MacBook Pro, Mac Mini and iMac\nlaunches in the year ago quarter. We expect Services revenue to grow at a\nyear-over-year rate similar to what we reported in the fiscal year 2025.\n\n\nWe expect gross margin to be between 47% and 48%, which includes an\nestimated impact of $1.4 billion of tariff-related costs. And as we've said\nbefore, we are significantly increasing our investments in AI while\ncontinuing to invest in our product road map. And so for the December\nquarter, we expect operating expenses to be between $18.1 billion and $18.5\nbillion. We expect OI&E to be around $150 million, excluding any potential\nimpact from the mark to market of minority investments and our tax rate to\nbe around 17%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash\ndividend of $0.26 per share of common stock payable on November 13, 2025,\nto shareholders of record as of November 10, 2025.\n\n\nWith that, let's open the call to questions.\n\n\nSuhasini  Chandramouli\nDirector of Investor Relations[Operator Instructions] Operator, may we have\nthe first question, please?\n\n\nQuestion and Answer\n\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly, we will go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring\nwith Morgan Stanley.\n\n\nErik William Richard Woodring\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\n\nCongrats on the results. Tim, can you maybe share a bit more detail on why\nyou think the iPhone 17 is having the degree of success that it is at this\npoint? And really, the question is do you believe this is the aged\ninstalled base replacement cycle kicking in or are there specific features\nor functionality you believe stand out this cycle versus past cycles that\nconsumers are really looking for. And then just a quick follow-up.\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nErik, thanks for your comments. I think it's all about the product. The\nproduct lineup is incredibly strong, our strongest ever. The 17 Pro is the\nmost pro phone we've ever done. It's incredible in the design things. The\niPhone Air is -- feels so thin and so light in your hand. It feels like\nit's going to fly away. And then the 17 phone is an incredible value and\ntakes several of the features that were reserved for Pro before and brings\nthem down to the consumer lineup. So overall, strongest iPhone lineup ever,\nand it's resonating around the world.\n\n\nErik William Richard Woodring\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\n\nGreat. And maybe a follow-up for you, Kevan. Can you maybe just discuss\nyour approach to managing component cost inflation during this time? You're\nobviously increasing the memory content in your devices quite\nsubstantially. At the same time, memory prices are going through some\npretty significant inflation. So just how are you managing through this\ncycle?\n\n\nKevan  Parekh\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nYes, Erik, thanks for the question. Look, as you know, we've got a pretty\nincredible world-class procurement team as we're constantly finding ways to\ncontinue to drive cost opportunities. Right now on the commodity side, I\nwould say we're seeing a slight tailwind on memory in storage prices and\nnothing really to note there. And as we saw from our gross margin\nperformance, we landed in a pretty good spot above the high end of the\nguidance range we provided at 47.2% and as well, we're guiding at 47% to\n48%.\n\n\nSo I think we're managing costs pretty well. As you'll recall, when we\ntalked about this time in the cycle, we just launched a bunch of new\nproducts. Those new products do have a slightly higher cost structure than\nthe products they replace, but the team does a very good job of focusing\nour efforts on getting those costs down over time. And we feel pretty good\nabout the performance we're seeing right now overall on material cost\nsavings.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research.\n\n\nBenjamin Alexander Reitzes\nMelius Research LLC\n\nTim, can you talk a little bit about iPhone in China specifically? How is\nthat going to trend in the December quarter? And have you turned the corner\nthere? And how do you think that trajectory is going? And then I have a\nquick follow-up.\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nYes. Ben, I was just there. It's incredibly vibrant and dynamic. The store\ntraffic is up significantly year-over-year. The iPhone 17 has been -- the\nfamily has been very well received there. We do believe that we'll return\nto growth in Q1, and that is largely based on the reception of the iPhone\nthere. And so I couldn't be more pleased with how things are going there in\nthe early going.\n\n\nBenjamin Alexander Reitzes\nMelius Research LLC\n\nAll right. That's great. And then Services, great upside there, a little\nsurprising, right? We were a little worried about that one only a few\nquarters ago. I was wondering if there were any tax payments in there or if\nthe resolution that we saw with the antitrust ruling with one of your\npartners was a boost and if that played a role or if it was all really just\norganic outperformance with many of the things you mentioned.\n\n\nKevan  Parekh\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nBen, it's Kevan here. Let me try to answer that question. You're referring\n-- I just wanted to clarify, when you're referring to the antitrust piece,\nyou're talking about the Google trial. Is that what you're referring to?\n\n\nBenjamin Alexander Reitzes\nMelius Research LLC\n\nYes. Yes, sir.\n\n\nKevan  Parekh\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nOkay. Yes, there was no tax-related impact. And what I would say is our\nstrong performance for the quarter is really organically driven. And again,\njust to reiterate, we had an all-time revenue record here for the quarter\nat $28.8 billion and as well, we surpassed $100 billion, so best year ever\nat 14% year-on-year. So really, that was all organic growth. As Tim\noutlined and I outlined in the prepared remarks, we saw a majority of the\ncategories have sequential acceleration, and we had many all-time revenue\nrecords. But nothing abnormal at all, really pretty much all organic\ngrowth.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Michael Ng.\n\n\nMichael  Ng\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\n\nI just have 2 as well. First, just to follow up on the last one. The\nservices revenue growth, I think, was the fastest across many categories\nand certainly the fastest in the last 2 years. I was just wondering if you\ncould just unpack a little bit more the drivers of the acceleration. Was\nthere kind of cross-selling with the new iPhone launch? Was it just\ninstalled base growth? I know you've been doing a lot of bundling with\nApple One and AppleCare One. So any thoughts on that would be very helpful.\nAnd then I just have a quick follow-up.\n\n\nKevan  Parekh\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nMichael, it's Kevan. Thanks for the question. Yes, let me build on the\nanswer there. I think that the way we look at it is not one thing to point\nto that would have driven this higher performance. You're right that it is\nslightly higher than we've seen in the last few quarters. But as you know,\nour Services portfolio is very broad with a broad range of businesses, all\nthat have different growth profiles and different performance\ncharacteristics, so those can vary in any given quarter. I would say our\nstrength, again, was very broad-based, both across categories and also\ngeographically. So I wouldn't point to any particular factor that drove any\nkind of outperformance at all. We were just very pleased to see that\nresult.\n\n\nMichael  Ng\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\n\nGreat. And just on iPhone sell-through, I was wondering if you were seeing\nany notable shifts in trends between the sell-through coming from upgraders\nversus switchers? Is the U.S. carrier competitive dynamic helping at all in\nterms of promotional activity? And any thoughts on channel inventory?\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nOkay. We did set a September quarter record for upgraders, and so it was a\ngreat quarter from that point of view. It's really too early in the cycle\non 17 to make any comments about upgraders or switchers. In terms of\nchannel inventory, we ended the quarter toward the low end of the targeted\nrange. Obviously, because we had constraints on the -- on several models of\nthe 16 and 17. And for complete transparency and clarity, we're constrained\ntoday on several models of the iPhone 17. There's not a ramp issue. It's\njust we have very strong demand, and we're working very hard to fulfill all\nthe orders that we have.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\n\n\nAmit Jawaharlaz Daryanani\nEvercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division\n\nI have 2 as well. I guess, Kevan, maybe just start with gross margins. Can\nyou just walk through the expectations for the December quarter? I think it\nimplies up 30 basis points or so sequentially. Can you just talk about the\nputs and takes on gross margin given you do have very sizable operating\nleverage in the quarter? So just maybe what are the puts and takes around\nthat would be really helpful.\n\n\nKevan  Parekh\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nYes, sure, Amit, let me walk through the outlook. As we mentioned in our\noutlook, we are targeting a range of 47% to 48%. You take the midpoint of\nthat range at 47.5%. You said it's roughly 25 basis points, 30 basis points\nhigher. Really, there's a lot of puts and takes. As I talked about earlier,\nthis is a quarter we launched a lot of new products. Those new products\ntend to have a higher cost structure than the products they replace. So\nthere's definitely an impact from the cost side of thing, but that was more\nthan offset by favorable mix, especially on the product side as well, as\nyou outlined, we typically see higher leverage in this quarter. So I would\nsay those are the 2 big drivers. And so the sequential increase is really\ngoing to be driven by favorable mix particularly from the product side.\n\n\nAmit Jawaharlaz Daryanani\nEvercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division\n\nGot it. And then if I just go back to the China discussion for a minute,\nthe performance in China, at least in the September quarter, was a bit\nmuted. Could you just talk about what resulted in the weakness over there?\nAnd do you think it was a bit more of a pause given iPhone Air, for\nexample, I don't think was available until a few weeks ago? So just\nsomewhat what drove the weakness in September? And is the uptick of that\nexpectation for December there just from the iPhone Air coming out? Or are\nthere other factors as well?\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nYes. The Greater China revenue was down 4% in the -- year-over-year in the\nSeptember quarter. It was driven by iPhone and if you look at the iPhone,\nthe majority of the sequential year-over-year change was due to supply\nconstraints that I mentioned earlier. And so it was basically supply\nconstraints that drove the results. We're thrilled with what we're seeing\nright now. With traffic being up significantly year-over-year and the\nreception of the 17 family, we expect to return to growth this quarter.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\n\n\nWamsi  Mohan\nBofA Securities, Research Division\n\nTim, if I can follow up on your comments about the constrained supply in\nthe quarter just given the very strong demand for iPhones, do you expect\nthat as you can see your visibility across demand and supply, do you think\nthat you will be exiting December at a point where you wouldn't be\nconstrained anymore? Or do you still expect that there could be constraints\nas you exit the December quarter? And any way to quantify sort of what\nrevenue could have been in this quarter without constraints?\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nYes. If you look at the supply constraints, today, we are constrained on\nseveral 17 models. We're not predicting when the supply/demand will\nbalance. We're obviously working very hard to achieve that because we want\nto get as many of these products out to the customers as possible. But\ntoday, I'm not going to predict.\n\n\nWamsi  Mohan\nBofA Securities, Research Division\n\nOkay. Okay. And then as a follow-up, I heard you talk about new records\nacross a lot of categories and services. I didn't hear search explicitly\ncalled out. So maybe it's a little bit of a follow-up to Ben's question.\nBut given that there are some concerns around search volumes decelerating\nat the expense of AI, how do you think about the broader sustainability of\nthese very strong mid-teens growth rates for Services over an extended\nperiod of time, not just for next quarter where you're obviously guiding to\n14%?\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nThis is Tim. The advertising category, which is a combination of third\nparty and first party did set a record during the quarter.\n\n\nWamsi  Mohan\nBofA Securities, Research Division\n\nOkay. And sorry, just to be clear, both Apple's own internal advertising\nand within the licensing individually set records?\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nActually, I'm not saying that. I'm just saying that the combination of the\n2 set a record. We don't -- I'm dodging the question intentionally because\nwe don't split it at that level.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.\n\n\nSamik  Chatterjee\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nMaybe for the first one, Tim, you talked about the strong momentum you're\nseeing in China, which is also driving your confidence for the December\nquarter. Any thoughts on the role that the smartphone subsidies in that\nregion are playing in this momentum? And how do you think about sort of\nwhat portion of consumers are maybe using some of those subsidies,\nleveraging the subsidies at this point? Any more insights into that? And I\nhave a follow-up.\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nYes, the subsidies play a favorable role. The subsidies, as you know, are\nsort of across multiple categories from PCs to tablets, smartwatches and\nsmartphones and -- however, it's important to note, they only apply to\ncertain price ranges. And so there's a maximum price, and there are several\nof our products that are -- that sell above that price and therefore, are\nnot eligible for a subsidy. And -- but it does have a favorable effect, and\nit's clearly and at least from our vantage point, driving some consumer\ndemand.\n\n\nSamik  Chatterjee\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nOkay. Okay. Got it. And a follow-up for Kevan here. On the OpEx increase\ngoing into the December quarter, a fairly sizable step-up. So if you could\njust dig into that number a bit more, what are sort of the components\ntowards what you're spending? And then that increase year-over-year in OpEx\ndoes sort of exceed your revenue growth. So is that sort of what we should\nexpect on a going forward basis as well where you probably need to invest a\nbit more in the near future?\n\n\nKevan  Parekh\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nYes, Samik, thanks for that question. As we've been outlining and\nreiterated in our last call, we are increasing our investments in AI. We're\nalso continuing to invest in our product road map. So the vast majority of\nthe increase to our operating expenses are driven by R&D.\n\n\nWhile we continue to manage the company in a thoughtful and disciplined\nway, we're also managing the business for the long term and are super\nexcited about all the opportunities that we see ahead. As it relates to the\nquestion around OpEx and revenue growth, while OpEx has been growing at a\nfaster rate than revenue, we have seen gross margin expansion. And so when\nwe look at that, on a combined basis, it does allow us to have healthy\noperating leverage, and our operating income growth has been generally\noutpacing revenue growth for the past several years.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from David Vogt with UBS.\n\n\nDavid  Vogt\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\n\nSo maybe, Kevan, can I ask first, can you help us understand sort of the\ntariff impact sequentially from the September quarter to the December\nquarter, particularly around iPhone supply constraints? Because I think I\nheard you say tariffs go from $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion, but the\nsequential uplift in iPhone revenue and presumably production given supply\nchain constraints is dramatically bigger. So you -- can you help us\nunderstand how to think about the timing of those tariff headwinds as we\nmove forward and sort of that correlation? And then I have a follow-up.\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nDavid, I'll take this one. You're right, it goes from $1.1 billion to a\nprojection of $1.4 billion. And the $1.4 billion is based on sort of what\nwe know right now and where the tariff rates and policies and so forth are.\nSo it assumes a stable kind of environment for the quarter. It does\ncomprehend the change that was just made, which we're very encouraged to\nsee with the tariffs moving from 20% to 10% in China. And so that is\nfactored in, and that is one of the reasons why the -- it's not linear to\nvolume if you will. Does that make sense?\n\n\nDavid  Vogt\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\n\nGot it. No, that's helpful. That's what I was asking, if the change is\nreflected in that outlook. And then just as a follow-up, when you think\nabout -- I think on the Macs, I know people aren't asking about it. You\ntalked about the tough comp, but you're going into sort of a holiday\nseason, and I understand that. But when you think about the attached\npossibility for other products to the iPhone in the holiday season, how do\nwe think about sort of where the consumers' heads that and their wallet is\nat this point in the cycle? And granted it is a tough comp, but is there an\nopportunity to see some maybe upside from an attach rate perspective given\nthe strength in the iPhone portfolio?\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nWe always like to remind people that buy an iPhone all the other things\nthat we offer, and so you can bet that we're doing that. From a Mac point\nof view, the challenge is that last year was sort of the mother of all Mac\nlaunches. All of these from Mac mini to iMac to all the MacBook Pros, all\nlaunched literally at the same time. And this year, that compares to\nlaunching the 14-inch MacBook Pro. And so there's a very difficult compare.\nOf course, in the long run, I'm very bullish on the Mac, and you can see\nthat the Mac again last quarter outgrew the market. And so we feel really\nwell about how Mac is positioned, but this certain quarter is an extremely\ndifficult compare.\n\n\nKevan  Parekh\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nYes. And Tim, I'll add to that, that we also have the DRAM upgrades last\nyear for the Mac lineup, also was another factor.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.\n\n\nKrish  Sankar\nTD Cowen, Research Division\n\nMy first one is on the iPhone constraints. Is there a way to quantify how\nmuch business you left on the table because of those constraints? And is\nthe different iPhone manufacturing from 2 different regions contributing to\nthe constraint? And then I have a follow-up for you.\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nTo be clear, the constraint was not related to manufacturing capacity per\nse. It was that we called the number of iPhone 16s that we were going to\nmake, and we're a bit short of where the demand really was. So we could\nhave sold more. We're not publicly at least estimating the extent of that.\nAnd then on iPhone 17 family, it's -- the demand is very strong, and so we\nobviously came out of the Q4 time frame with lots of back orders.\n\n\nKrish  Sankar\nTD Cowen, Research Division\n\nGot it. And then a quick follow-up. Given like the prevalence of chatbots\nand now some of these AI-infused web services, do you think that could\nchange the consumer behavior on mobile app ecosystems? Or are you seeing\nany of that? And would that have any impact on your App Store?\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nI think there are opportunities on the App Store with artificial\nintelligence. And so I think as we have made our on-device models available\nfor developers and we've seen developers begin to adopt them and so I think\nas you -- as that proliferates, there's an opportunity to -- for developers\nand for Apple to benefit from that, from adding features to their apps and\nso forth.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\n\n\nAaron Christopher Rakers\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\n\nI had 2 as well. I guess the first question is when we look at the iPhone\n17 demand, which you've repeatedly highlighted is very strong, I'm curious\nif there's been any discernible kind of change in the mix within the iPhone\n17 categories between the Pro and the Pro Max versions relative to prior\ncycles.\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nIt's really too early to call the mix to be honest, and we don't like to\npublicly disclose that because of -- for competitive reasons. But frankly,\nwe don't really know what the mix will be yet because we have constraints\non both sides of the ledger at the top and at the entry. And so we'll see\nwhat happens as we get more supply.\n\n\nAaron Christopher Rakers\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\n\nYes. And then as a quick follow-up, I'm curious, as we kind of work through\nkind of the AI narrative that continues to build. Is there -- could you\nprovide any kind of updated thoughts around the build-out of Apple's\nprivate compute cloud and how we should think about that kind of as we look\nforward?\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nYes. We're obviously using PCC, our Private Cloud Compute, today for a\nnumber of queries for Siri, and we will continue to build it out. In fact,\nthe manufacturing plant that makes the servers used for Apple Intelligence\njust started manufacturing in Houston a few weeks ago, and we've got a ramp\nplan there for use in our data centers and it's robust.\n\n\nKevan  Parekh\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nYes. Aaron, I'll add maybe there, too, since you asked a question about\nPrivate Cloud Compute that we -- in '25, we did have CapEx costs associated\nwith building out our Private Cloud Compute environment in our first-party\ndata centers. So you would have seen that in some of the CapEx investment\nin the year.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Atif Malik with Citi.\n\n\nAtif  Malik\nCitigroup Inc., Research Division\n\nGreat execution. The first question is on iPhone Air. Does the consumer\nreception on iPhone Air gives you a feel on perhaps the foldable phone\nmarket? Or are the 2 form factors very different?\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nI'm not sure that they're -- that one is a proxy for the other. The thing\nthat I would say is that we're -- we don't get into the model kind of\ndemand. At the aggregate level, we are thrilled with how iPhone has been\nreceived, and that's the reason that we're expecting double-digit growth in\nthe current quarter.\n\n\nAtif  Malik\nCitigroup Inc., Research Division\n\nGreat. And Tim, as a follow-up, good to know that the personalized Siri is\nmaking good progress and on track for next year. Will you continue to use a\nthree-pronged approach with your own foundation models and partner with\nother LLM providers and maybe potential M&A? Or is one strategy more\nemphasized over another?\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nWe're obviously creating Apple foundation models within Apple. We ship them\non device and use them in the Private Cloud Compute as well. And we've got\nseveral in development. And so we also, from a -- continually to surveil\nthe market on M&A and are open to pursuing M&A if we think that it will\nadvance our road map.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research.\n\n\nRichard Alan Kramer\nArete Research Services LLP\n\nTim, we've often seen Apple be a fast follower with iPhone and new\ntechnology, whether large displays or 4G or 5G. But with all the hype now\naround AI, are you seeing evidence that AI capabilities or features are a\nmaterial purchase consideration for consumers or the record sales levels\nyou're reporting simply reflecting other factors like the retention of your\niOS base?\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nI think that there are many factors that influence people's purchasing\nconsiderations and so -- and we don't have a great in-depth survey yet on\nthe current iPhone 17 because it's very new in the cycle, and we give it\nsome time to formulate. But I would say that Apple Intelligence is a\nfactor, and we're very bullish on it becoming a greater factor. And so\nthat's the way that we look at it.\n\n\nRichard Alan Kramer\nArete Research Services LLP\n\nOkay. And then one for Kevan. In the wake of nearly every other large tech\ncompany massively increasing their CapEx in advance of AI demand and also\nmentioning that there's scarce capacity, do you anticipate Apple altering\nits sort of long-standing hybrid approach to your own and third-party data\ncenters? And maybe can you talk a little bit about the role you see for\nApple silicon with the new M5 series of chipsets?\n\n\nKevan  Parekh\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nRichard, thanks for the question. In general, I think as we've talked about\nbefore, we are expecting increases in our CapEx spending related to AI\ninvestments. For example, as I mentioned earlier, we did end up having\ninvestments this year to build out our Private Cloud Compute environment.\nAnd we do believe this hybrid model has served us very well, and we\ncontinue to want to leverage it. And so I don't see us moving away from\nthis hybrid model where we leverage both first-party capacity as well as\nleverage third-party capacity. We'll continue to want to build out Private\nCloud Compute, as Tim outlined, as we have more usage there over time. But\nI think, in general, we want to continue to have this hybrid model.\n\n\nSuhasini  Chandramouli\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Richard.

Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the\ncall. Today, Apple is proud to report $102.5 billion in revenue, up 8% from\na year ago and a September quarter record. Services achieved an all-time\nrevenue record of $28.8 billion, growing 15% from a year ago. EPS came in\nat $1.85, setting a September quarter record. We grew in the vast majority\nof markets we track and had September quarter revenue records in dozens of\nmarkets, including the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, the\nMiddle East, Japan, Korea and South Asia. We also set a September quarter\nrevenue record in emerging markets and an all-time revenue record in India.\nThese results come at the close of an extraordinary year for Apple in which\nwe achieved an all-time revenue record of $416 billion for the fiscal year.\n\n\n\nWe set all-time revenue records in emerging and developed markets. We set\nan all-time revenue record for iPhone. And in Services, we achieved all-\ntime records across every geographic segment. These results reflect the\ntremendous customer enthusiasm for Apple products and services as well as\nour deep commitment to innovation. We are incredibly excited about the\nstrength we're seeing across our products and services, and we expect the\nDecember quarter's revenue to be the best ever for the company and the best\never for iPhone.\n\n\nWe are heading into the holiday season with a truly remarkable lineup. That\nincludes the biggest leap ever for iPhone, which has had a tremendous\nresponse from our users around the world. Our Apple Watch lineup is more\ncapable than ever, too, giving users ways to take charge of their health\nlike never before through new features like hypertension notifications and\nsleep score. And the next-level sound quality and active noise cancellation\nof AirPods Pro 3 are hitting all the right notes for our users.\n\n\nIn October, we also broke new ground in power-efficient performance with\nthe uncomparably fast M5 chip packed with neural accelerators in each GPU\ncore to supercharge AI workflows. iPad Pro combines game-changing features\non iPadOS 26 with the power of M5 to create our most capable iPad ever. At\nthe same time, the M5 MacBook Pro raises the bar for what users can do with\na laptop while the new M5 -- powered Apple Vision Pro opens up amazing\npossibilities on its infinite canvas.\n\n\nWe also launched a beautiful new software design that creates a unified\nexperience across all of our platforms for the very first time. The design\nis crafted with a new material called Liquid Glass that brings fluidity,\nvitality and flexibility to our products. Along with the new design, we\ndelivered powerful new features to enable users to do even more with their\ndevices. That includes updates to the Phone and messages apps in iOS 26 to\nhelp users stay connected, continuity enhancements in Mac to deliver an\neven more seamless experience across devices and a powerful new windowing\nsystem that fundamentally transforms the user experience on iPadOS 26.\n\n\nAs we continue to expand our investment in AI, we're bringing intelligence\nto more of what people already love about our products and services, making\nevery experience even more personal, capable and effortless. At the heart\nof it all is Apple silicon, and we were thrilled to launch new products\npowered by the A19 Pro chip and M5. These incredibly advanced chips make\nApple products the very best place to experience the power of AI.\n\n\nWith Apple Intelligence, we've introduced dozens of new features that are\npowerful, intuitive, private and deeply integrated into the things people\ndo every day, features like Live Translation, which help users communicate\nacross languages in real time; and visual intelligence, which opens new\nways to learn about and explore the world. We also introduced Workout\nBuddy, a new experience that uses AI to provide personalized motivational\ninsights based on a user's workout data and fitness history.\n\n\nAnd these joined so many others from Clean Up in photos and new image\ncreation tools to powerful writing tools. We're also seeing developers take\nadvantage of our own device foundation models to create entirely new\nexperiences for users around the world. We're also excited for our more\npersonalized Siri. We're making good progress on it, and as we've shared,\nwe expect to release it next year.\n\n\nNow let's take a closer look at the September quarter results across our\nlineup, starting with iPhone. iPhone set a revenue record for the September\nquarter at $49 billion, up 6% from a year ago, with growth in the vast\nmajority of markets we track despite supply constraints we faced on several\niPhone 16 and iPhone 17 models given strong demand. Redesigned from the\ninside out and powered by the outstanding A19 Pro chip, the iPhone 17 Pro\nis by far the most powerful iPhone we've ever made, setting a whole new\nstandard for the smartphone industry. The iPhone 17 Pro also offers our\nbest camera system ever with an all-new 8x telephoto camera and looks\nstunning with bold new finishes like Cosmic Orange. The iPhone Air\nintroduces an incredibly breakthrough design and with a bigger and brighter\ndisplay with ProMotion, the iPhone 17 is a fantastic upgrade packed with\nfeatures users will love.\n\n\nIn Mac, we had a strong September quarter with revenue of $8.7 billion, up\n13% year-over-year driven by the strength of the MacBook Air. The MacBook\nAir enables users to get things done easily on the world's most popular\nlaptop. Mac mini users are loving how much performance is packed into our\nsmallest Mac ever made, while Mac Studio customers are pushing the envelope\nof what's possible with our most powerful Mac ever. And the latest 14-inch\nMacBook Pro unlocks incredible speed and next-level performance with the\nall-new M5 chip, which delivers 3.5x faster AI performance than M4.\n\n\nTurning to iPad. Revenue was $7 billion for the September quarter. Last\nmonth, we released one of the most attention grabbing software updates\nwe've had in years with iPadOS 26 and we recently gave iPad users even more\nto love with the launch of the incredible M5 iPad Pro, which offers an\nincredible boost in AI performance. With an unmatched combination of power\nand versatility, the new iPad Pro makes every interaction delightful with\nits thin, light and portable design.\n\n\nIn Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue was $9 billion. As I mentioned\nearlier, we were excited to unlock new possibilities for users with the\nlaunch of our newest Apple Watch lineup, making the world's most popular\nwatch even better. That includes Apple Watch Ultra 3 with the largest\ndisplay ever in an Apple Watch, improved battery life and emergency SOS via\nsatellite. Apple Watch Series 11 brings our users the most comprehensive\nset of health features yet. And Apple Watch SE 3 delivers advanced\ncapabilities at an incredible value.\n\n\nAI and advanced machine learning are at the core of powerful health\nfeatures like heart rate monitoring, fall detection, crash detection and\nmore. With our latest Apple Watch lineup, we were proud to introduce\nhypertension notifications, developed using large-scale machine learning\nmodels. Hypertension is one of the leading risk factors for heart attack\nand stroke affecting more than 1 billion adults worldwide, and we expect to\nnotify more than 1 million users of this life-threatening condition. We're\nalso excited about sleep score, a simple, intuitive way to help users\nbetter understand their sleep quality and discover ways to improve it.\nThat's something I'm sure we can all benefit from.\n\n\nMeanwhile, AirPods Pro 3 have been a huge hit. You have to hear them to\nreally understand just how remarkable they are. users and reviewers alike\nare praising their incredible sound quality and improved fit. They feature\nthe world's best in-ear active noise cancellation, removing up to 2x as\nmuch noise as the previous generation. And with Live Translation powered by\nApple Intelligence, AirPods deliver an incredibly new and exciting\nexperience for users around the world.\n\n\nTurning to Services. As I mentioned earlier, revenue was $28.8 billion for\nthe September quarter, 15% higher year-over-year and an all-time record. We\nsaw double-digit growth in both developed and emerging markets and set new\nall-time records across advertising, App Store, cloud services, Music,\npayment services and video.\n\n\nApple TV celebrated a big night at this year's Emmy Awards with 22 wins.\nThe studio led the night with 13 wins, the most of any comedy series in\nEmmy's history. Severance topped all dramas with 8 wins, adding to the\naccolades for this landmark series. To date, Apple TV productions have now\nearned over 600 wins and 2,800 nominations in total, driven by powerful\noriginal storytelling. And we're excited for audiences to discover new\nproductions like Pluribus and to catch returning favorites like Slow Horses\nand The Morning Show.\n\n\nAnd soon, Apple TV will be the destination for F1 fans across the U.S. on\ntrack day, thanks to a new partnership with Formula 1. F1 is one of the\nmost exciting and fastest-growing sports in the world, and starting next\nyear, Apple TV will be the place for subscribers to follow every twist and\nturn of the new season. And in addition, F1, the movie, one of the year's\nbiggest blockbusters, will be coming to Apple TV on December 12.\n\n\nDuring the September quarter, we also marked the 10-year anniversary of\nApple News. Apple News provides access to front page news from all around\nthe world, putting hundreds of publications right at users' fingertips.\n\n\nTurning to retail. We're heading into our busiest time of year with our\nbest ever lineup. In the last few months, we've opened new stores in\nemerging markets like India and the UAE and new locations in the U.S. and\nChina. I was also in Tokyo last month for the opening of the redesigned and\nreimagined Apple Ginza store, and the energy among the crowd was truly\nremarkable. When it originally opened, it was our first store outside the\nUnited States, and so it was especially meaningful to come back to welcome\ncustomers to the beautiful new space.\n\n\nEverywhere we operate and in everything we do, we strive to give the best\nto our users while living by our values, whether that's building new\naccessibility features into our most recent software releases or advancing\nour environmental work by using even more recycled materials in our latest\nlineup or providing free educational programming to train and support\nAmerican businesses with our new Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit.\nAnd we're continuing to invest in innovation and user experiences that will\ntransform our future.\n\n\nA great example is the work we're doing in the U.S. where we're committed\nto invest $600 billion over the next 4 years with a focus on innovation in\nstrategic areas like advanced manufacturing, silicon engineering and\nartificial intelligence. These commitments build on our long-standing\ninvestments in America while supporting more than 450,000 jobs with\nthousands of suppliers across all 50 states. We built a new factory in\nHouston for advanced AI service, for example, which just started shipping\nits first products off the line, and we're leading the creation of end-to-\nend silicon supply chain across the country.\n\n\nIn recent months, I've connected with developers, innovators, artists,\nentrepreneurs and so many others around the world, people passionate about\ninnovation and all the things they can do with Apple products. Each one is\nanother reminder of why we do what we do. We're driven to empower people to\ndo more of the things that matter most to them and enrich their lives along\nthe way. As we head into the holiday season with our most powerful lineup\never, I couldn't be more excited for what's to come.\n\n\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Kevan.\n\n\nKevan  Parekh\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Our revenue of $102.5 billion\nwas up 8% year-over-year and is a new September quarter record. We set\nSeptember quarter records in the Americas, Europe, Japan and the rest of\nAsia Pacific and grew in the vast majority of markets we track. Products\nrevenue was $73.7 billion, up 5% year-over-year, driven by growth across\niPhone and Mac and reached a September quarter record. Thanks to our\nexceptional customer satisfaction and strong levels of loyalty, our\ninstalled base of active devices has reached another all-time high across\nall product categories and geographic segments. Services revenue was $28.8\nbillion, up 15% year-over-year and an all-time record. The performance was\nbroad-based, with double-digit growth in the vast majority of the markets\nwe track and double-digit growth across most of our Services categories.\n\n\nCompany gross margin was 47.2%, above the high end of our guidance range\nand up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by favorable mix. This includes\napproximately $1.1 billion of tariff-related costs, which is in line with\nwhat we had estimated on our last call. Products gross margin was 36.2%, up\n170 basis points sequentially driven by favorable mix. Services gross\nmargin was 75.3%, down 30 basis points sequentially. Operating expenses\nlanded at $15.9 billion, up 11% year-over-year, driven by increased\ninvestment in R&D. These strong levels of business performance led to\nSeptember quarter records for both net income and diluted earnings per\nshare.\n\n\nNet income was $27.5 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $1.85, up\n13% year-over-year on an adjusted basis, excluding the onetime charge we\nrecognized during the fourth quarter of 2024. Operating cash flow was also\na September quarter record at $29.7 billion.\n\n\nNow I'm going to provide some more details for each of our revenue\ncategories. iPhone revenue was $49 billion, up 6% year-over-year, driven by\nthe iPhone 16 family. iPhone grew in the vast majority of the markets we\ntrack with September quarter records in many emerging markets, including\nLatin America, the Middle East and South Asia and an all-time record in\nIndia. The iPhone active installed base grew to an all-time high, and we\nset a September quarter record for upgraders.\n\n\nAccording to the recent survey from Worldpanel, iPhone was the top-selling\nmodel in the U.S., urban China, the U.K., France, Australia and Japan. We\ncontinue to see very high levels of customer satisfaction in the U.S. at\n98% as measured by 451 Research. Mac revenue was $8.7 billion, up 13% year-\nover-year, driven by MacBook Air. We grew in every geographic segment with\nstrong double-digit growth in emerging markets. The Mac installed base\nreached another all-time high with nearly half of customers who purchased a\nMac being new to the product. And the latest customer satisfaction for Mac\nin the U.S. was reported at 96%.\n\n\niPad revenue was $7 billion, flat year-over-year. Keep in mind, we faced a\ndifficult compare against the full quarter impact of the iPad Air and iPad\nPro launch from last year, offset by the better-than-expected performance\non the iPad. The installed base reached an all-time high with a September\nquarter record for upgraders and over half of the customers who purchased\nan iPad during the quarter were new to the product. Based on the latest\nreports from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 98% in the U.S.\n\n\nWearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $9 billion, flat year-over-\nyear. This was driven by growth on Watch and AirPods, offset by\naccessories, which was impacted by strong performance in the year ago\nquarter, driven by the iPad launches. Both the Apple Watch and AirPods\ninstalled bases reached new all-time highs. Over half of the customers\npurchasing Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product, and we\nalso set a September record for upgraders on Apple Watch. And in the U.S.,\ncustomer satisfaction was recently measured at 95%.\n\n\nOur Services revenue reached an all-time high of $28.8 billion, up 15% year-\nover-year. We achieved all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe,\nJapan and rest of Asia Pacific as well as a September quarter record in\nGreater China.\n\n\nThe majority of categories saw a sequential acceleration, and as Tim\nmentioned, we set many all-time revenue records, including payment\nservices, where we reached an all-time revenue record and saw a double-\ndigit growth year-over-year on Apple Pay active users. This strong momentum\nin the September quarter drove our total fiscal year services revenue to\nsurpass $100 billion, up 14% year-over-year and our best ever. The growth\nof our installed base of active devices continues to offer us great\nopportunities for the future.\n\n\nCustomer engagement across our services offerings also continue to grow.\nBoth transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs, and we\ncontinue to improve the quality and expand the reach of our services\nofferings. From additional markets for Apple Pay, now available in nearly\n90 countries, to AppleCare One, a great new way to cover multiple Apple\nproducts in a single plan.\n\n\nTurning to enterprise. We are seeing an adoption of Apple products\naccelerate across industries to improve productivity and drive innovation.\nThe BMW Group has been deploying tens of thousands of iPhones, including\nthe factory employees to further strengthen its digital capabilities and\nadvance innovation at the company. Capital One has expanded its Mac choice\nprogram by adding thousands more MacBook Airs across its workforce.\n\n\nIn the Czech Republic, its largest bank, Ceska sporitelna, continues to\ninvest in the Apple ecosystem with over 5,000 iPhones in addition to its\nexisting thousands of iPads and Macs. And Purdue University has launched a\nspatial computing hub built around Vision Pro, designed to help prepare\nstudents to lead the next wave of innovation in critical industries like\nsemiconductor and pharmaceutical manufacturing.\n\n\nLet's turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the\nquarter with $132 billion in cash and marketable securities. We had $1.3\nbillion of debt maturities and decreased commercial paper by $1.9 billion,\nresulting in $99 billion in total debt. Therefore, at the end of the\nquarter, net cash was $34 billion.\n\n\nDuring the quarter, we returned $24 billion to shareholders. This included\n$3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $20 billion through open\nmarket repurchases of 89 million Apple shares.\n\n\nTaking a step back, we are very pleased with our record fiscal year 2025\nresults. As Tim mentioned, total company revenue for the year was $416\nbillion with growth in iPhone, Mac, iPad and Services and all-time records\nin the vast majority of markets we track. This revenue performance led to\nvery strong full year operating results with all-time records for net\nincome and for diluted EPS, which grew double digits year-over-year on an\nadjusted basis.\n\n\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook,\nwhich includes the types of forward-looking information Suhasini referred\nto. Importantly, the color we're providing assumes that the global tariff\nrates, policies and application remain in effect as of this call and the\nglobal macroeconomic outlook does not worsen from today. We expect our\nDecember quarter total company revenue to grow by 10% to 12% year-over-\nyear, which will be our best quarter ever.\n\n\nWe expect iPhone revenue to grow double digits year-over-year, which would\nbe our best iPhone quarter ever. On Mac, keep in mind, we expect to face a\nvery difficult compare against the M4 MacBook Pro, Mac Mini and iMac\nlaunches in the year ago quarter. We expect Services revenue to grow at a\nyear-over-year rate similar to what we reported in the fiscal year 2025.\n\n\nWe expect gross margin to be between 47% and 48%, which includes an\nestimated impact of $1.4 billion of tariff-related costs. And as we've said\nbefore, we are significantly increasing our investments in AI while\ncontinuing to invest in our product road map. And so for the December\nquarter, we expect operating expenses to be between $18.1 billion and $18.5\nbillion. We expect OI&E to be around $150 million, excluding any potential\nimpact from the mark to market of minority investments and our tax rate to\nbe around 17%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash\ndividend of $0.26 per share of common stock payable on November 13, 2025,\nto shareholders of record as of November 10, 2025.\n\n\nWith that, let's open the call to questions.\n\n\nSuhasini  Chandramouli\nDirector of Investor Relations[Operator Instructions] Operator, may we have\nthe first question, please?",
  "qa_text": "Operator\n\nCertainly, we will go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring\nwith Morgan Stanley.\n\n\nErik William Richard Woodring\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\n\nCongrats on the results. Tim, can you maybe share a bit more detail on why\nyou think the iPhone 17 is having the degree of success that it is at this\npoint? And really, the question is do you believe this is the aged\ninstalled base replacement cycle kicking in or are there specific features\nor functionality you believe stand out this cycle versus past cycles that\nconsumers are really looking for. And then just a quick follow-up.\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nErik, thanks for your comments. I think it's all about the product. The\nproduct lineup is incredibly strong, our strongest ever. The 17 Pro is the\nmost pro phone we've ever done. It's incredible in the design things. The\niPhone Air is -- feels so thin and so light in your hand. It feels like\nit's going to fly away. And then the 17 phone is an incredible value and\ntakes several of the features that were reserved for Pro before and brings\nthem down to the consumer lineup. So overall, strongest iPhone lineup ever,\nand it's resonating around the world.\n\n\nErik William Richard Woodring\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\n\nGreat. And maybe a follow-up for you, Kevan. Can you maybe just discuss\nyour approach to managing component cost inflation during this time? You're\nobviously increasing the memory content in your devices quite\nsubstantially. At the same time, memory prices are going through some\npretty significant inflation. So just how are you managing through this\ncycle?\n\n\nKevan  Parekh\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nYes, Erik, thanks for the question. Look, as you know, we've got a pretty\nincredible world-class procurement team as we're constantly finding ways to\ncontinue to drive cost opportunities. Right now on the commodity side, I\nwould say we're seeing a slight tailwind on memory in storage prices and\nnothing really to note there. And as we saw from our gross margin\nperformance, we landed in a pretty good spot above the high end of the\nguidance range we provided at 47.2% and as well, we're guiding at 47% to\n48%.\n\n\nSo I think we're managing costs pretty well. As you'll recall, when we\ntalked about this time in the cycle, we just launched a bunch of new\nproducts. Those new products do have a slightly higher cost structure than\nthe products they replace, but the team does a very good job of focusing\nour efforts on getting those costs down over time. And we feel pretty good\nabout the performance we're seeing right now overall on material cost\nsavings.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research.\n\n\nBenjamin Alexander Reitzes\nMelius Research LLC\n\nTim, can you talk a little bit about iPhone in China specifically? How is\nthat going to trend in the December quarter? And have you turned the corner\nthere? And how do you think that trajectory is going? And then I have a\nquick follow-up.\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nYes. Ben, I was just there. It's incredibly vibrant and dynamic. The store\ntraffic is up significantly year-over-year. The iPhone 17 has been -- the\nfamily has been very well received there. We do believe that we'll return\nto growth in Q1, and that is largely based on the reception of the iPhone\nthere. And so I couldn't be more pleased with how things are going there in\nthe early going.\n\n\nBenjamin Alexander Reitzes\nMelius Research LLC\n\nAll right. That's great. And then Services, great upside there, a little\nsurprising, right? We were a little worried about that one only a few\nquarters ago. I was wondering if there were any tax payments in there or if\nthe resolution that we saw with the antitrust ruling with one of your\npartners was a boost and if that played a role or if it was all really just\norganic outperformance with many of the things you mentioned.\n\n\nKevan  Parekh\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nBen, it's Kevan here. Let me try to answer that question. You're referring\n-- I just wanted to clarify, when you're referring to the antitrust piece,\nyou're talking about the Google trial. Is that what you're referring to?\n\n\nBenjamin Alexander Reitzes\nMelius Research LLC\n\nYes. Yes, sir.\n\n\nKevan  Parekh\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nOkay. Yes, there was no tax-related impact. And what I would say is our\nstrong performance for the quarter is really organically driven. And again,\njust to reiterate, we had an all-time revenue record here for the quarter\nat $28.8 billion and as well, we surpassed $100 billion, so best year ever\nat 14% year-on-year. So really, that was all organic growth. As Tim\noutlined and I outlined in the prepared remarks, we saw a majority of the\ncategories have sequential acceleration, and we had many all-time revenue\nrecords. But nothing abnormal at all, really pretty much all organic\ngrowth.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Michael Ng.\n\n\nMichael  Ng\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\n\nI just have 2 as well. First, just to follow up on the last one. The\nservices revenue growth, I think, was the fastest across many categories\nand certainly the fastest in the last 2 years. I was just wondering if you\ncould just unpack a little bit more the drivers of the acceleration. Was\nthere kind of cross-selling with the new iPhone launch? Was it just\ninstalled base growth? I know you've been doing a lot of bundling with\nApple One and AppleCare One. So any thoughts on that would be very helpful.\nAnd then I just have a quick follow-up.\n\n\nKevan  Parekh\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nMichael, it's Kevan. Thanks for the question. Yes, let me build on the\nanswer there. I think that the way we look at it is not one thing to point\nto that would have driven this higher performance. You're right that it is\nslightly higher than we've seen in the last few quarters. But as you know,\nour Services portfolio is very broad with a broad range of businesses, all\nthat have different growth profiles and different performance\ncharacteristics, so those can vary in any given quarter. I would say our\nstrength, again, was very broad-based, both across categories and also\ngeographically. So I wouldn't point to any particular factor that drove any\nkind of outperformance at all. We were just very pleased to see that\nresult.\n\n\nMichael  Ng\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\n\nGreat. And just on iPhone sell-through, I was wondering if you were seeing\nany notable shifts in trends between the sell-through coming from upgraders\nversus switchers? Is the U.S. carrier competitive dynamic helping at all in\nterms of promotional activity? And any thoughts on channel inventory?\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nOkay. We did set a September quarter record for upgraders, and so it was a\ngreat quarter from that point of view. It's really too early in the cycle\non 17 to make any comments about upgraders or switchers. In terms of\nchannel inventory, we ended the quarter toward the low end of the targeted\nrange. Obviously, because we had constraints on the -- on several models of\nthe 16 and 17. And for complete transparency and clarity, we're constrained\ntoday on several models of the iPhone 17. There's not a ramp issue. It's\njust we have very strong demand, and we're working very hard to fulfill all\nthe orders that we have.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\n\n\nAmit Jawaharlaz Daryanani\nEvercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division\n\nI have 2 as well. I guess, Kevan, maybe just start with gross margins. Can\nyou just walk through the expectations for the December quarter? I think it\nimplies up 30 basis points or so sequentially. Can you just talk about the\nputs and takes on gross margin given you do have very sizable operating\nleverage in the quarter? So just maybe what are the puts and takes around\nthat would be really helpful.\n\n\nKevan  Parekh\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nYes, sure, Amit, let me walk through the outlook. As we mentioned in our\noutlook, we are targeting a range of 47% to 48%. You take the midpoint of\nthat range at 47.5%. You said it's roughly 25 basis points, 30 basis points\nhigher. Really, there's a lot of puts and takes. As I talked about earlier,\nthis is a quarter we launched a lot of new products. Those new products\ntend to have a higher cost structure than the products they replace. So\nthere's definitely an impact from the cost side of thing, but that was more\nthan offset by favorable mix, especially on the product side as well, as\nyou outlined, we typically see higher leverage in this quarter. So I would\nsay those are the 2 big drivers. And so the sequential increase is really\ngoing to be driven by favorable mix particularly from the product side.\n\n\nAmit Jawaharlaz Daryanani\nEvercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division\n\nGot it. And then if I just go back to the China discussion for a minute,\nthe performance in China, at least in the September quarter, was a bit\nmuted. Could you just talk about what resulted in the weakness over there?\nAnd do you think it was a bit more of a pause given iPhone Air, for\nexample, I don't think was available until a few weeks ago? So just\nsomewhat what drove the weakness in September? And is the uptick of that\nexpectation for December there just from the iPhone Air coming out? Or are\nthere other factors as well?\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nYes. The Greater China revenue was down 4% in the -- year-over-year in the\nSeptember quarter. It was driven by iPhone and if you look at the iPhone,\nthe majority of the sequential year-over-year change was due to supply\nconstraints that I mentioned earlier. And so it was basically supply\nconstraints that drove the results. We're thrilled with what we're seeing\nright now. With traffic being up significantly year-over-year and the\nreception of the 17 family, we expect to return to growth this quarter.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\n\n\nWamsi  Mohan\nBofA Securities, Research Division\n\nTim, if I can follow up on your comments about the constrained supply in\nthe quarter just given the very strong demand for iPhones, do you expect\nthat as you can see your visibility across demand and supply, do you think\nthat you will be exiting December at a point where you wouldn't be\nconstrained anymore? Or do you still expect that there could be constraints\nas you exit the December quarter? And any way to quantify sort of what\nrevenue could have been in this quarter without constraints?\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nYes. If you look at the supply constraints, today, we are constrained on\nseveral 17 models. We're not predicting when the supply/demand will\nbalance. We're obviously working very hard to achieve that because we want\nto get as many of these products out to the customers as possible. But\ntoday, I'm not going to predict.\n\n\nWamsi  Mohan\nBofA Securities, Research Division\n\nOkay. Okay. And then as a follow-up, I heard you talk about new records\nacross a lot of categories and services. I didn't hear search explicitly\ncalled out. So maybe it's a little bit of a follow-up to Ben's question.\nBut given that there are some concerns around search volumes decelerating\nat the expense of AI, how do you think about the broader sustainability of\nthese very strong mid-teens growth rates for Services over an extended\nperiod of time, not just for next quarter where you're obviously guiding to\n14%?\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nThis is Tim. The advertising category, which is a combination of third\nparty and first party did set a record during the quarter.\n\n\nWamsi  Mohan\nBofA Securities, Research Division\n\nOkay. And sorry, just to be clear, both Apple's own internal advertising\nand within the licensing individually set records?\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nActually, I'm not saying that. I'm just saying that the combination of the\n2 set a record. We don't -- I'm dodging the question intentionally because\nwe don't split it at that level.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.\n\n\nSamik  Chatterjee\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nMaybe for the first one, Tim, you talked about the strong momentum you're\nseeing in China, which is also driving your confidence for the December\nquarter. Any thoughts on the role that the smartphone subsidies in that\nregion are playing in this momentum? And how do you think about sort of\nwhat portion of consumers are maybe using some of those subsidies,\nleveraging the subsidies at this point? Any more insights into that? And I\nhave a follow-up.\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nYes, the subsidies play a favorable role. The subsidies, as you know, are\nsort of across multiple categories from PCs to tablets, smartwatches and\nsmartphones and -- however, it's important to note, they only apply to\ncertain price ranges. And so there's a maximum price, and there are several\nof our products that are -- that sell above that price and therefore, are\nnot eligible for a subsidy. And -- but it does have a favorable effect, and\nit's clearly and at least from our vantage point, driving some consumer\ndemand.\n\n\nSamik  Chatterjee\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nOkay. Okay. Got it. And a follow-up for Kevan here. On the OpEx increase\ngoing into the December quarter, a fairly sizable step-up. So if you could\njust dig into that number a bit more, what are sort of the components\ntowards what you're spending? And then that increase year-over-year in OpEx\ndoes sort of exceed your revenue growth. So is that sort of what we should\nexpect on a going forward basis as well where you probably need to invest a\nbit more in the near future?\n\n\nKevan  Parekh\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nYes, Samik, thanks for that question. As we've been outlining and\nreiterated in our last call, we are increasing our investments in AI. We're\nalso continuing to invest in our product road map. So the vast majority of\nthe increase to our operating expenses are driven by R&D.\n\n\nWhile we continue to manage the company in a thoughtful and disciplined\nway, we're also managing the business for the long term and are super\nexcited about all the opportunities that we see ahead. As it relates to the\nquestion around OpEx and revenue growth, while OpEx has been growing at a\nfaster rate than revenue, we have seen gross margin expansion. And so when\nwe look at that, on a combined basis, it does allow us to have healthy\noperating leverage, and our operating income growth has been generally\noutpacing revenue growth for the past several years.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from David Vogt with UBS.\n\n\nDavid  Vogt\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\n\nSo maybe, Kevan, can I ask first, can you help us understand sort of the\ntariff impact sequentially from the September quarter to the December\nquarter, particularly around iPhone supply constraints? Because I think I\nheard you say tariffs go from $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion, but the\nsequential uplift in iPhone revenue and presumably production given supply\nchain constraints is dramatically bigger. So you -- can you help us\nunderstand how to think about the timing of those tariff headwinds as we\nmove forward and sort of that correlation? And then I have a follow-up.\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nDavid, I'll take this one. You're right, it goes from $1.1 billion to a\nprojection of $1.4 billion. And the $1.4 billion is based on sort of what\nwe know right now and where the tariff rates and policies and so forth are.\nSo it assumes a stable kind of environment for the quarter. It does\ncomprehend the change that was just made, which we're very encouraged to\nsee with the tariffs moving from 20% to 10% in China. And so that is\nfactored in, and that is one of the reasons why the -- it's not linear to\nvolume if you will. Does that make sense?\n\n\nDavid  Vogt\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\n\nGot it. No, that's helpful. That's what I was asking, if the change is\nreflected in that outlook. And then just as a follow-up, when you think\nabout -- I think on the Macs, I know people aren't asking about it. You\ntalked about the tough comp, but you're going into sort of a holiday\nseason, and I understand that. But when you think about the attached\npossibility for other products to the iPhone in the holiday season, how do\nwe think about sort of where the consumers' heads that and their wallet is\nat this point in the cycle? And granted it is a tough comp, but is there an\nopportunity to see some maybe upside from an attach rate perspective given\nthe strength in the iPhone portfolio?\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nWe always like to remind people that buy an iPhone all the other things\nthat we offer, and so you can bet that we're doing that. From a Mac point\nof view, the challenge is that last year was sort of the mother of all Mac\nlaunches. All of these from Mac mini to iMac to all the MacBook Pros, all\nlaunched literally at the same time. And this year, that compares to\nlaunching the 14-inch MacBook Pro. And so there's a very difficult compare.\nOf course, in the long run, I'm very bullish on the Mac, and you can see\nthat the Mac again last quarter outgrew the market. And so we feel really\nwell about how Mac is positioned, but this certain quarter is an extremely\ndifficult compare.\n\n\nKevan  Parekh\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nYes. And Tim, I'll add to that, that we also have the DRAM upgrades last\nyear for the Mac lineup, also was another factor.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.\n\n\nKrish  Sankar\nTD Cowen, Research Division\n\nMy first one is on the iPhone constraints. Is there a way to quantify how\nmuch business you left on the table because of those constraints? And is\nthe different iPhone manufacturing from 2 different regions contributing to\nthe constraint? And then I have a follow-up for you.\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nTo be clear, the constraint was not related to manufacturing capacity per\nse. It was that we called the number of iPhone 16s that we were going to\nmake, and we're a bit short of where the demand really was. So we could\nhave sold more. We're not publicly at least estimating the extent of that.\nAnd then on iPhone 17 family, it's -- the demand is very strong, and so we\nobviously came out of the Q4 time frame with lots of back orders.\n\n\nKrish  Sankar\nTD Cowen, Research Division\n\nGot it. And then a quick follow-up. Given like the prevalence of chatbots\nand now some of these AI-infused web services, do you think that could\nchange the consumer behavior on mobile app ecosystems? Or are you seeing\nany of that? And would that have any impact on your App Store?\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nI think there are opportunities on the App Store with artificial\nintelligence. And so I think as we have made our on-device models available\nfor developers and we've seen developers begin to adopt them and so I think\nas you -- as that proliferates, there's an opportunity to -- for developers\nand for Apple to benefit from that, from adding features to their apps and\nso forth.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\n\n\nAaron Christopher Rakers\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\n\nI had 2 as well. I guess the first question is when we look at the iPhone\n17 demand, which you've repeatedly highlighted is very strong, I'm curious\nif there's been any discernible kind of change in the mix within the iPhone\n17 categories between the Pro and the Pro Max versions relative to prior\ncycles.\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nIt's really too early to call the mix to be honest, and we don't like to\npublicly disclose that because of -- for competitive reasons. But frankly,\nwe don't really know what the mix will be yet because we have constraints\non both sides of the ledger at the top and at the entry. And so we'll see\nwhat happens as we get more supply.\n\n\nAaron Christopher Rakers\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\n\nYes. And then as a quick follow-up, I'm curious, as we kind of work through\nkind of the AI narrative that continues to build. Is there -- could you\nprovide any kind of updated thoughts around the build-out of Apple's\nprivate compute cloud and how we should think about that kind of as we look\nforward?\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nYes. We're obviously using PCC, our Private Cloud Compute, today for a\nnumber of queries for Siri, and we will continue to build it out. In fact,\nthe manufacturing plant that makes the servers used for Apple Intelligence\njust started manufacturing in Houston a few weeks ago, and we've got a ramp\nplan there for use in our data centers and it's robust.\n\n\nKevan  Parekh\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nYes. Aaron, I'll add maybe there, too, since you asked a question about\nPrivate Cloud Compute that we -- in '25, we did have CapEx costs associated\nwith building out our Private Cloud Compute environment in our first-party\ndata centers. So you would have seen that in some of the CapEx investment\nin the year.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Atif Malik with Citi.\n\n\nAtif  Malik\nCitigroup Inc., Research Division\n\nGreat execution. The first question is on iPhone Air. Does the consumer\nreception on iPhone Air gives you a feel on perhaps the foldable phone\nmarket? Or are the 2 form factors very different?\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nI'm not sure that they're -- that one is a proxy for the other. The thing\nthat I would say is that we're -- we don't get into the model kind of\ndemand. At the aggregate level, we are thrilled with how iPhone has been\nreceived, and that's the reason that we're expecting double-digit growth in\nthe current quarter.\n\n\nAtif  Malik\nCitigroup Inc., Research Division\n\nGreat. And Tim, as a follow-up, good to know that the personalized Siri is\nmaking good progress and on track for next year. Will you continue to use a\nthree-pronged approach with your own foundation models and partner with\nother LLM providers and maybe potential M&A? Or is one strategy more\nemphasized over another?\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nWe're obviously creating Apple foundation models within Apple. We ship them\non device and use them in the Private Cloud Compute as well. And we've got\nseveral in development. And so we also, from a -- continually to surveil\nthe market on M&A and are open to pursuing M&A if we think that it will\nadvance our road map.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research.\n\n\nRichard Alan Kramer\nArete Research Services LLP\n\nTim, we've often seen Apple be a fast follower with iPhone and new\ntechnology, whether large displays or 4G or 5G. But with all the hype now\naround AI, are you seeing evidence that AI capabilities or features are a\nmaterial purchase consideration for consumers or the record sales levels\nyou're reporting simply reflecting other factors like the retention of your\niOS base?\n\n\nTimothy D. Cook\nCEO & Director\n\nI think that there are many factors that influence people's purchasing\nconsiderations and so -- and we don't have a great in-depth survey yet on\nthe current iPhone 17 because it's very new in the cycle, and we give it\nsome time to formulate. But I would say that Apple Intelligence is a\nfactor, and we're very bullish on it becoming a greater factor. And so\nthat's the way that we look at it.\n\n\nRichard Alan Kramer\nArete Research Services LLP\n\nOkay. And then one for Kevan. In the wake of nearly every other large tech\ncompany massively increasing their CapEx in advance of AI demand and also\nmentioning that there's scarce capacity, do you anticipate Apple altering\nits sort of long-standing hybrid approach to your own and third-party data\ncenters? And maybe can you talk a little bit about the role you see for\nApple silicon with the new M5 series of chipsets?\n\n\nKevan  Parekh\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nRichard, thanks for the question. In general, I think as we've talked about\nbefore, we are expecting increases in our CapEx spending related to AI\ninvestments. For example, as I mentioned earlier, we did end up having\ninvestments this year to build out our Private Cloud Compute environment.\nAnd we do believe this hybrid model has served us very well, and we\ncontinue to want to leverage it. And so I don't see us moving away from\nthis hybrid model where we leverage both first-party capacity as well as\nleverage third-party capacity. We'll continue to want to build out Private\nCloud Compute, as Tim outlined, as we have more usage there over time. But\nI think, in general, we want to continue to have this hybrid model.\n\n\nSuhasini  Chandramouli\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Richard.

      "text": "CEO & Director Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is proud to report $102.5 billion in revenue, up 8% from a year ago and a September quarter record. Services achieved an all-time revenue record of $28.8 billion, growing 15% from a year ago. EPS came in at $1.85, setting a September quarter record. We grew in the vast majority of markets we track and had September quarter revenue records in dozens of markets, including the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East, Japan, Korea and South Asia. We also set a September quarter revenue record in emerging markets and an all-time revenue record in India. These results come at the close of an extraordinary year for Apple in which we achieved an all-time revenue record of $416 billion for the fiscal year. We set all-time revenue records in emerging and developed markets. We set an all-time revenue record for iPhone. And in Services, we achieved all- time records across every geographic segment. These results reflect the tremendous customer enthusiasm for Apple products and services as well as our deep commitment to innovation. We are incredibly excited about the strength we're seeing across our products and services, and we expect the December quarter's revenue to be the best ever for the company and the best ever for iPhone. We are heading into the holiday season with a truly remarkable lineup. That includes the biggest leap ever for iPhone, which has had a tremendous response from our users around the world. Our Apple Watch lineup is more capable than ever, too, giving users ways to take charge of their health like never before through new features like hypertension notifications and sleep score. And the next-level sound quality and active noise cancellation of AirPods Pro 3 are hitting all the right notes for our users. In October, we also broke new ground in power-efficient performance with the uncomparably fast M5 chip packed with neural accelerators in each GPU core to supercharge AI workflows. iPad Pro combines game-changing features on iPadOS 26 with the power of M5 to create our most capable iPad ever. At the same time, the M5 MacBook Pro raises the bar for what users can do with a laptop while the new M5 -- powered Apple Vision Pro opens up amazing possibilities on its infinite canvas. We also launched a beautiful new software design that creates a unified experience across all of our platforms for the very first time. The design is crafted with a new material called Liquid Glass that brings fluidity, vitality and flexibility to our products. Along with the new design, we delivered powerful new features to enable users to do even more with their devices. That includes updates to the Phone and messages apps in iOS 26 to help users stay connected, continuity enhancements in Mac to deliver an even more seamless experience across devices and a powerful new windowing system that fundamentally transforms the user experience on iPadOS 26. As we continue to expand our investment in AI, we're bringing intelligence to more of what people already love about our products and services, making every experience even more personal, capable and effortless. At the heart of it all is Apple silicon, and we were thrilled to launch new products powered by the A19 Pro chip and M5. These incredibly advanced chips make Apple products the very best place to experience the power of AI. With Apple Intelligence, we've introduced dozens of new features that are powerful, intuitive, private and deeply integrated into the things people do every day, features like Live Translation, which help users communicate across languages in real time; and visual intelligence, which opens new ways to learn about and explore the world. We also introduced Workout Buddy, a new experience that uses AI to provide personalized motivational insights based on a user's workout data and fitness history. And these joined so many others from Clean Up in photos and new image creation tools to powerful writing tools. We're also seeing developers take advantage of our own device foundation models to create entirely new experiences for users around the world. We're also excited for our more personalized Siri. We're making good progress on it, and as we've shared, we expect to release it next year. Now let's take a closer look at the September quarter results across our lineup, starting with iPhone. iPhone set a revenue record for the September quarter at $49 billion, up 6% from a year ago, with growth in the vast majority of markets we track despite supply constraints we faced on several iPhone 16 and iPhone 17 models given strong demand. Redesigned from the inside out and powered by the outstanding A19 Pro chip, the iPhone 17 Pro is by far the most powerful iPhone we've ever made, setting a whole new standard for the smartphone industry. The iPhone 17 Pro also offers our best camera system ever with an all-new 8x telephoto camera and looks stunning with bold new finishes like Cosmic Orange. The iPhone Air introduces an incredibly breakthrough design and with a bigger and brighter display with ProMotion, the iPhone 17 is a fantastic upgrade packed with features users will love. In Mac, we had a strong September quarter with revenue of $8.7 billion, up 13% year-over-year driven by the strength of the MacBook Air. The MacBook Air enables users to get things done easily on the world's most popular laptop. Mac mini users are loving how much performance is packed into our smallest Mac ever made, while Mac Studio customers are pushing the envelope of what's possible with our most powerful Mac ever. And the latest 14-inch MacBook Pro unlocks incredible speed and next-level performance with the all-new M5 chip, which delivers 3.5x faster AI performance than M4. Turning to iPad. Revenue was $7 billion for the September quarter. Last month, we released one of the most attention grabbing software updates we've had in years with iPadOS 26 and we recently gave iPad users even more to love with the launch of the incredible M5 iPad Pro, which offers an incredible boost in AI performance. With an unmatched combination of power and versatility, the new iPad Pro makes every interaction delightful with its thin, light and portable design. In Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue was $9 billion. As I mentioned earlier, we were excited to unlock new possibilities for users with the launch of our newest Apple Watch lineup, making the world's most popular watch even better. That includes Apple Watch Ultra 3 with the largest display ever in an Apple Watch, improved battery life and emergency SOS via satellite. Apple Watch Series 11 brings our users the most comprehensive set of health features yet. And Apple Watch SE 3 delivers advanced capabilities at an incredible value. AI and advanced machine learning are at the core of powerful health features like heart rate monitoring, fall detection, crash detection and more. With our latest Apple Watch lineup, we were proud to introduce hypertension notifications, developed using large-scale machine learning models. Hypertension is one of the leading risk factors for heart attack and stroke affecting more than 1 billion adults worldwide, and we expect to notify more than 1 million users of this life-threatening condition. We're also excited about sleep score, a simple, intuitive way to help users better understand their sleep quality and discover ways to improve it. That's something I'm sure we can all benefit from. Meanwhile, AirPods Pro 3 have been a huge hit. You have to hear them to really understand just how remarkable they are. users and reviewers alike are praising their incredible sound quality and improved fit. They feature the world's best in-ear active noise cancellation, removing up to 2x as much noise as the previous generation. And with Live Translation powered by Apple Intelligence, AirPods deliver an incredibly new and exciting experience for users around the world. Turning to Services. As I mentioned earlier, revenue was $28.8 billion for the September quarter, 15% higher year-over-year and an all-time record. We saw double-digit growth in both developed and emerging markets and set new all-time records across advertising, App Store, cloud services, Music, payment services and video. Apple TV celebrated a big night at this year's Emmy Awards with 22 wins. The studio led the night with 13 wins, the most of any comedy series in Emmy's history. Severance topped all dramas with 8 wins, adding to the accolades for this landmark series. To date, Apple TV productions have now earned over 600 wins and 2,800 nominations in total, driven by powerful original storytelling. And we're excited for audiences to discover new productions like Pluribus and to catch returning favorites like Slow Horses and The Morning Show. And soon, Apple TV will be the destination for F1 fans across the U.S. on track day, thanks to a new partnership with Formula 1. F1 is one of the most exciting and fastest-growing sports in the world, and starting next year, Apple TV will be the place for subscribers to follow every twist and turn of the new season. And in addition, F1, the movie, one of the year's biggest blockbusters, will be coming to Apple TV on December 12. During the September quarter, we also marked the 10-year anniversary of Apple News. Apple News provides access to front page news from all around the world, putting hundreds of publications right at users' fingertips. Turning to retail. We're heading into our busiest time of year with our best ever lineup. In the last few months, we've opened new stores in emerging markets like India and the UAE and new locations in the U.S. and China. I was also in Tokyo last month for the opening of the redesigned and reimagined Apple Ginza store, and the energy among the crowd was truly remarkable. When it originally opened, it was our first store outside the United States, and so it was especially meaningful to come back to welcome customers to the beautiful new space. Everywhere we operate and in everything we do, we strive to give the best to our users while living by our values, whether that's building new accessibility features into our most recent software releases or advancing our environmental work by using even more recycled materials in our latest lineup or providing free educational programming to train and support American businesses with our new Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit. And we're continuing to invest in innovation and user experiences that will transform our future. A great example is the work we're doing in the U.S. where we're committed to invest $600 billion over the next 4 years with a focus on innovation in strategic areas like advanced manufacturing, silicon engineering and artificial intelligence. These commitments build on our long-standing investments in America while supporting more than 450,000 jobs with thousands of suppliers across all 50 states. We built a new factory in Houston for advanced AI service, for example, which just started shipping its first products off the line, and we're leading the creation of end-to- end silicon supply chain across the country. In recent months, I've connected with developers, innovators, artists, entrepreneurs and so many others around the world, people passionate about innovation and all the things they can do with Apple products. Each one is another reminder of why we do what we do. We're driven to empower people to do more of the things that matter most to them and enrich their lives along the way. As we head into the holiday season with our most powerful lineup ever, I couldn't be more excited for what's to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevan."

      "speaker": "Kevan  Parekh",
      "role": "Senior VP & CFO",
      "text": "Senior VP & CFO Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Our revenue of $102.5 billion was up 8% year-over-year and is a new September quarter record. We set September quarter records in the Americas, Europe, Japan and the rest of Asia Pacific and grew in the vast majority of markets we track. Products revenue was $73.7 billion, up 5% year-over-year, driven by growth across iPhone and Mac and reached a September quarter record. Thanks to our exceptional customer satisfaction and strong levels of loyalty, our installed base of active devices has reached another all-time high across all product categories and geographic segments. Services revenue was $28.8 billion, up 15% year-over-year and an all-time record. The performance was broad-based, with double-digit growth in the vast majority of the markets we track and double-digit growth across most of our Services categories. Company gross margin was 47.2%, above the high end of our guidance range and up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by favorable mix. This includes approximately $1.1 billion of tariff-related costs, which is in line with what we had estimated on our last call. Products gross margin was 36.2%, up 170 basis points sequentially driven by favorable mix. Services gross margin was 75.3%, down 30 basis points sequentially. Operating expenses landed at $15.9 billion, up 11% year-over-year, driven by increased investment in R&D. These strong levels of business performance led to September quarter records for both net income and diluted earnings per share. Net income was $27.5 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $1.85, up 13% year-over-year on an adjusted basis, excluding the onetime charge we recognized during the fourth quarter of 2024. Operating cash flow was also a September quarter record at $29.7 billion. Now I'm going to provide some more details for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $49 billion, up 6% year-over-year, driven by the iPhone 16 family. iPhone grew in the vast majority of the markets we track with September quarter records in many emerging markets, including Latin America, the Middle East and South Asia and an all-time record in India. The iPhone active installed base grew to an all-time high, and we set a September quarter record for upgraders. According to the recent survey from Worldpanel, iPhone was the top-selling model in the U.S., urban China, the U.K., France, Australia and Japan. We continue to see very high levels of customer satisfaction in the U.S. at 98% as measured by 451 Research. Mac revenue was $8.7 billion, up 13% year- over-year, driven by MacBook Air. We grew in every geographic segment with strong double-digit growth in emerging markets. The Mac installed base reached another all-time high with nearly half of customers who purchased a Mac being new to the product. And the latest customer satisfaction for Mac in the U.S. was reported at 96%. iPad revenue was $7 billion, flat year-over-year. Keep in mind, we faced a difficult compare against the full quarter impact of the iPad Air and iPad Pro launch from last year, offset by the better-than-expected performance on the iPad. The installed base reached an all-time high with a September quarter record for upgraders and over half of the customers who purchased an iPad during the quarter were new to the product. Based on the latest reports from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 98% in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $9 billion, flat year-over- year. This was driven by growth on Watch and AirPods, offset by accessories, which was impacted by strong performance in the year ago quarter, driven by the iPad launches. Both the Apple Watch and AirPods installed bases reached new all-time highs. Over half of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product, and we also set a September record for upgraders on Apple Watch. And in the U.S., customer satisfaction was recently measured at 95%. Our Services revenue reached an all-time high of $28.8 billion, up 15% year- over-year. We achieved all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, Japan and rest of Asia Pacific as well as a September quarter record in Greater China. The majority of categories saw a sequential acceleration, and as Tim mentioned, we set many all-time revenue records, including payment services, where we reached an all-time revenue record and saw a double- digit growth year-over-year on Apple Pay active users. This strong momentum in the September quarter drove our total fiscal year services revenue to surpass $100 billion, up 14% year-over-year and our best ever. The growth of our installed base of active devices continues to offer us great opportunities for the future. Customer engagement across our services offerings also continue to grow. Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs, and we continue to improve the quality and expand the reach of our services offerings. From additional markets for Apple Pay, now available in nearly 90 countries, to AppleCare One, a great new way to cover multiple Apple products in a single plan. Turning to enterprise. We are seeing an adoption of Apple products accelerate across industries to improve productivity and drive innovation. The BMW Group has been deploying tens of thousands of iPhones, including the factory employees to further strengthen its digital capabilities and advance innovation at the company. Capital One has expanded its Mac choice program by adding thousands more MacBook Airs across its workforce. In the Czech Republic, its largest bank, Ceska sporitelna, continues to invest in the Apple ecosystem with over 5,000 iPhones in addition to its existing thousands of iPads and Macs. And Purdue University has launched a spatial computing hub built around Vision Pro, designed to help prepare students to lead the next wave of innovation in critical industries like semiconductor and pharmaceutical manufacturing. Let's turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $132 billion in cash and marketable securities. We had $1.3 billion of debt maturities and decreased commercial paper by $1.9 billion, resulting in $99 billion in total debt. Therefore, at the end of the quarter, net cash was $34 billion. During the quarter, we returned $24 billion to shareholders. This included $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $20 billion through open market repurchases of 89 million Apple shares. Taking a step back, we are very pleased with our record fiscal year 2025 results. As Tim mentioned, total company revenue for the year was $416 billion with growth in iPhone, Mac, iPad and Services and all-time records in the vast majority of markets we track. This revenue performance led to very strong full year operating results with all-time records for net income and for diluted EPS, which grew double digits year-over-year on an adjusted basis. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information Suhasini referred to. Importantly, the color we're providing assumes that the global tariff rates, policies and application remain in effect as of this call and the global macroeconomic outlook does not worsen from today. We expect our December quarter total company revenue to grow by 10% to 12% year-over- year, which will be our best quarter ever. We expect iPhone revenue to grow double digits year-over-year, which would be our best iPhone quarter ever. On Mac, keep in mind, we expect to face a very difficult compare against the M4 MacBook Pro, Mac Mini and iMac launches in the year ago quarter. We expect Services revenue to grow at a year-over-year rate similar to what we reported in the fiscal year 2025. We expect gross margin to be between 47% and 48%, which includes an estimated impact of $1.4 billion of tariff-related costs. And as we've said before, we are significantly increasing our investments in AI while continuing to invest in our product road map. And so for the December quarter, we expect operating expenses to be between $18.1 billion and $18.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $150 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark to market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 17%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per share of common stock payable on November 13, 2025, to shareholders of record as of November 10, 2025. With that, let's open the call to questions."

The 17 Pro is the most pro phone we've ever done. It's incredible in the design things. The iPhone Air is -- feels so thin and so light in your hand. It feels like it's going to fly away. And then the 17 phone is an incredible value and takes several of the features that were reserved for Pro before and brings them down to the consumer lineup. So overall, strongest iPhone lineup ever, and it's resonating around the world."

So just how are you managing through this cycle?"

Look, as you know, we've got a pretty incredible world-class procurement team as we're constantly finding ways to continue to drive cost opportunities. Right now on the commodity side, I would say we're seeing a slight tailwind on memory in storage prices and nothing really to note there. And as we saw from our gross margin performance, we landed in a pretty good spot above the high end of the guidance range we provided at 47.2% and as well, we're guiding at 47% to 48%. So I think we're managing costs pretty well. As you'll recall, when we talked about this time in the cycle, we just launched a bunch of new products. Those new products do have a slightly higher cost structure than the products they replace, but the team does a very good job of focusing our efforts on getting those costs down over time. And we feel pretty good about the performance we're seeing right now overall on material cost savings."

But as you know, our Services portfolio is very broad with a broad range of businesses, all that have different growth profiles and different performance characteristics, so those can vary in any given quarter. I would say our strength, again, was very broad-based, both across categories and also geographically. So I wouldn't point to any particular factor that drove any kind of outperformance at all.

Obviously, because we had constraints on the -- on several models of the 16 and 17. And for complete transparency and clarity, we're constrained today on several models of the iPhone 17.

You said it's roughly 25 basis points, 30 basis points higher. Really, there's a lot of puts and takes. As I talked about earlier, this is a quarter we launched a lot of new products. Those new products tend to have a higher cost structure than the products they replace. So there's definitely an impact from the cost side of thing, but that was more than offset by favorable mix, especially on the product side as well, as you outlined, we typically see higher leverage in this quarter. So I would say those are the 2 big drivers. And so the sequential increase is really going to be driven by favorable mix particularly from the product side."

While we continue to manage the company in a thoughtful and disciplined way, we're also managing the business for the long term and are super excited about all the opportunities that we see ahead. As it relates to the question around OpEx and revenue growth, while OpEx has been growing at a faster rate than revenue, we have seen gross margin expansion. And so when we look at that, on a combined basis, it does allow us to have healthy operating leverage, and our operating income growth has been generally outpacing revenue growth for the past several years."
