My name is Tiffany, and I will be\nyour conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome\neveryone to the Oracle Corporation Q1 FY 2026 Conference Call.\n\n\n[Operator Instructions]\n\n\nI would now like to turn the call over to Ken Bond, Head of Investor\nRelations. Ken, please go ahead.\n\n\nKen  Bond\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Tiffany. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's First\nQuarter Fiscal Year 2026 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press\nrelease and financial tables, which include a GAAP to non-GAAP\nreconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed\nand downloaded from our Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of\nmany customers who purchased Oracle Cloud Services or went live on Oracle\nCloud recently will be available from the Investor Relations website. On\nthe call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison;\nand Chief Executive Officer, Safra Catz.\n\n\nAs a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements,\nincluding predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that\nmight be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will\npresent some important factors relating to our business, which may include\n-- which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These\nforward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that\nmay cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made\ntoday. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these\nforward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent\nreports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a\ncomplete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our\nfuture results or the market price of our stock.\n\n\nAnd finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these\nforward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.\nBefore taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks.\n\n\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.\n\n\nSafra Ada Catz\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Clearly, we had an amazing start\nto the year because Oracle has become the go-to place for AI workloads. We\nhave signed significant cloud contracts with the who's who of AI, including\nOpenAI, xAI, Meta, NVIDIA, AMD and many others. At the end of Q1, remaining\nperformance obligations, or RPO, now to $455 billion. This is up 359% from\nlast year and up $317 billion from the end of Q4. Our cloud RPO grew nearly\n500% on top of 83% growth last year.\n\n\nNow to the results using constant currency growth rate. As you can see,\nwe've made some changes to the face of our income statement to better\nreflect how we manage the business and so you can understand our cloud\nbusiness dynamics more directly. So here goes. Total cloud revenue, that's\nboth Apps and Infrastructure was up 27% to $7.2 billion. Cloud\ninfrastructure revenue was $3.3 billion, up 54% on top of the 46% growth\nreported in Q1 last year. OCI consumption revenue was up [ 57% ] and demand\ncontinues to dramatically outstrip supply. Cloud database services, which\nwere up 32%, now have annualized revenues of nearly $2.8 billion.\nAutonomous Database revenue was up 43% on top of the 26% growth reported in\nQ1 last year. Multi-cloud database revenue, where OCI regions are embedded\nin AWS, Azure and GCP grew 1,529% in Q1.\n\n\nCloud application revenue was $3.8 billion and up 10%, while our strategic\nback-office application revenue was $2.4 billion, up 16%. Total software\nrevenue for the quarter was $5.7 billion, down 2%. So all in, total\nrevenues for the quarter were $14.9 billion, up 11% from last year and\nhigher than the 8% growth reported in Q1 last year. Operating income grew\n7% to $6.2 billion. We have also been on an accelerated journey to adopt AI\ninternally to run more efficiently. I expect our operating income will grow\nmid-teens this year and higher still in FY '27. Non-GAAP EPS was USD 1.47\nin U.S. dollars, while GAAP EPS was USD 1.01 in U.S. dollars. The non-GAAP\ntax rate for the quarter was 20.5%, which was higher than the 19% guidance\nand caused EPS to be $0.03 lower. For the last 4 quarters, operating cash\nflow was up 13% to $21.5 billion, and free cash flow was a negative $5.9\nbillion with $27.4 billion of CapEx. Operating cash flow for Q1 was $8.1\nbillion, while free cash flow was a negative $362 million with CapEx of\n$8.5 billion.\n\n\nAt quarter end, we had $11 billion in cash and marketable securities and\nshort-term deferred revenue balance was $12 billion, up 5%. Over the last\n10 years, we've reduced the shares outstanding by 1/3 at an average price\nof $55, which is, at this point, much less than 1/4 of our current stock\nprice. This quarter, we repurchased 440,000 shares for a total of $95\nmillion. In addition, we paid out dividends of $5 billion over the last 12\nmonths, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of\n$0.50 per share. Given our RPO growth, I now expect fiscal year '26 CapEx\nwill be around $35 billion. As a reminder, the vast majority of our CapEx\ninvestments are for revenue-generating equipment that is going into the\ndata centers and not for land or buildings. As we bring more capacity\nonline, we will convert the large RPO backlog into accelerating revenue and\nprofit growth.\n\n\nNow before I dive into specific Q2 guidance, I'd like to share some of the\noverarching thoughts on fiscal year '26 and the coming years. Clearly, it\nwas an excellent quarter and demand for Oracle Cloud infrastructure\ncontinues to build. I expect we will sign additional multibillion-dollar\ncustomers and that RPO will likely grow to exceed $0.5 trillion. The\nenormity of this RPO growth enables us to make a large upward revision to\nthe cloud infrastructure portion of our financial plan. We now expect\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure will grow 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year\nand then increase to $32 billion, $73 billion, $114 billion and $144\nbillion over the following 4 years. Much of this revenue is already booked\nin our $455 billion RPO number, and we are off to a fantastic start this\nyear.\n\n\nNow while much attention is focused on our GPU-related business, our non-\nGPU infrastructure business continues to grow much faster than our\ncompetitors. We are also seeing our industry-specific cloud applications\ndrive customers to our back-office cloud apps. And finally, the Oracle\ndatabase is booming with 34 multi-cloud data centers now live inside of\nAzure, GCP and AWS, and we will deliver another 37 data centers for a total\nof 71. All these trends point to revenue growth going higher.\n\n\nFor fiscal year 2026, we remain confident and committed to full year total\nrevenue growth of 16% in constant currency. Beyond fiscal year '26, I'm\neven more confident in our ability to further accelerate our top and bottom\nline growth rate. As mentioned, we will provide an update on our long-range\nfinancial targets at our Financial Analyst Meeting at Oracle AI World in\nLas Vegas in October.\n\n\nNow let me turn to my guidance for Q2, which I'll review on a non-GAAP\nbasis and assuming currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now.\nCurrency should have a $0.03 positive impact on EPS and a 1% positive\neffect on revenue, depending on rounding. However, the actual currency\nimpact may be different as it was in Q1. Here goes. Total revenue are\nexpected to grow from 12% to 14% in constant currency and are expected to\ngrow from 14% to 16% in U.S. dollars at today's exchange rate. Total cloud\nrevenue is expected to grow from 32% to 36% in constant currency and is\nexpected to grow from 33% to 37% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow\nbetween 8% to 10% and between -- be between $1.58 and $1.62 in constant\ncurrency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow 10% to 12% and be between USD\n$1.61 and USD 1.65. And lastly, my EPS guidance for Q2 assumes a base tax\nrate of 19%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates to\nvary as they did this quarter.\n\n\nLarry, over to you.\n\n\nLawrence J. Ellison\nCo-Founder, Chairman & CTO\n\nThank you, Safra. Eventually, AI will change everything. But right now, AI\nis fundamentally transforming Oracle and the rest of the computer industry,\nthough not everyone fully grasp the extent of the tsunami that is\napproaching. Look at our quarterly numbers. Some things are undeniably\nevident. Several world-class AI companies have chosen Oracle to build large-\nscale GPU-centric data centers to train their AI models. That's because\nOracle builds gigawatt scale data centers that are faster and more cost\nefficient at training AI models than anyone else in the world. Training AI\nmodels is a gigantic multitrillion-dollar market. It's hard to conceive of\na technology market as large as that one. But if you look close, you can\nfind one that's even larger. And it's the market for AI inferencing.\nMillions of customers using those AI models to run businesses and\ngovernments. In fact, the AI inferencing market will be much, much larger\nthan the AI training market.\n\n\nAI inferencing will be used to run robotic factories, robotic cars, robotic\ngreenhouses, biomolecular simulations for drug design, interpreting medical\ndiagnostic images and laboratory results, automating laboratories, placing\nbets in financial markets, automating legal processes, automating financial\nprocesses, automating sales processes. AI is going to write that is\ngenerate the computer programs called AI agents. That will automate your\nsales and marketing processes. Let me repeat that. AI is going to\nautomatically write the computer programs that will then automate your\nsales processes and your legal processes and everything else and in your\nfactories and so on. Think about it. AI inferencing, it's AI inferencing\nthat will change everything. Oracle is aggressively pursuing the AI. And\nwe're not doing badly in the AI training market, by the way. With\ninferencing figure, oracle is aggressively pursuing the inferencing market\nas well as the AI training market.\n\n\nWe think we are in a pretty good position to be a winner in the inferencing\nmarket because Oracle is by far the world's largest custodian of high-value\nprivate enterprise data. With the introduction of our new AI database, we\nadded a very important new way for you to store your data in our database.\nYou can vectorize it. And by vectorizing it, by vectorizing all your data,\nall your data can be understood by AI models. Then we made it very easy for\nour customers to directly connect all their databases, all their new Oracle\nAI databases and cloud storage, OCI Cloud storage to the world's most\nadvanced AI reasoning models, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Llama, all of which\nare uniquely available in the Oracle Cloud. After you vectorize your data\nand link it to an LLM, the LLM of your choice, you can then ask any\nquestion you can think of.\n\n\nFor example, how will the latest tariffs impact next quarter's revenue and\nprofit? You asked that question, the large language model will then apply\nadvanced reasoning to the combination of your private enterprise data plus\npublicly available data. you get answers to important questions without\never compromising the safety and security of your private data. Again, I'd\nlike you to think about this for a moment. A lot of companies are saying,\nwe're big into AI because we're writing agents. Well, guess what, we're\nwriting a bunch of agents, too. But when they introduced ChatGPT almost 3\nyears ago, what you got to do is have a conversation and ask questions. You\ndidn't -- you weren't automating some process with an agent. You could ask\nwhatever question you wanted to ask and get a well-reasoned answer with all\nof the latest and best information and high-quality reason go along with\nit.\n\n\nWho's offering that to customers? We'll be the first when we deliver it and\ndemonstrate it at AI World next month. That's what our customers have been\nasking for ever since the introduction of ChatGPT 3.5 almost 3 years ago. I\nwant to ask questions about anything. And therefore, you need to understand\nmy enterprise data as well as all the publicly available data. Then you can\nanswer the questions that are most important to me.\nWell, now they can ask those questions. Back to you, Safra.\n\n\nQuestion and Answer\n\n\nKen  Bond\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Larry. Tiffany, please pull the audience for questions.\n\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Instructions]\n\n\nYour first question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Guggenheim\nSecurities.\n\n\nJohn Stephen DiFucci\nGuggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division\n\nListen, even I am sort of blown away by what this looks like going forward.\nAnd this question, I guess, is sort of purposely open-ended. So Larry and\nSafra, Oracle has become the de facto standard for AI training workloads\nand you make money at it and I have a lot of faith in that. But clearly,\nthere's more here than just AI training. I know it's a big part of it. You\ntalked about it. But can you talk about what else -- a little more detail\nabout what else is driving these pretty amazing forecasts?\n\n\nSafra Ada Catz\nCEO & Director\n\nGo ahead, Larry. I think you were covering this.\n\n\nLawrence J. Ellison\nCo-Founder, Chairman & CTO\n\nYes. Well, it's -- a lot of people are looking for inferencing capacity. I\nmean people are running out of inferencing capacity. I mean the company\nthat called us -- I mentioned it, I think either last quarter or the\nquarter before, someone called us, we'll take all the capacity you have\nthat's currently not being used anywhere in the world. We don't care. And\nI've never gotten a call like that. That's a very unusual call. That was\nfor inferencing, not training. There is a huge amount of demand for\ninferencing. And if you think about it, in the end, all this money we're\nspending on training is going to have to be translated into products that\nare sold, which is all inferencing.\n\n\nAnd the inferencing market, again, is much larger than the training market.\nAnd yes, we are building -- like everybody else, we're building agents with\nour applications. But we're doing much more than that. No one's shown me a\nChatGPT 3.5, again, 3 years ago, 3.5 -- 3 years ago, a little less than 3\nyears ago, when the ChatGPT amazed the world, and you could simply talk to\nyour computer and ask questions and get well reasoned well questions based\non the latest and most precise information as long as you ask those\nquestions about publicly available data, and there's a lot of publicly\navailable data.\n\n\nBut if you combine the publicly available data with the enterprise data,\nwhich companies really don't want to share, you have to do it in such a way\nthat your private enterprise data stays private, yet the large language\nmodel can still use it for reasoning so as to answer your question, like\nhow do the latest tariffs or the latest steel prices or whatever affect my\nquarterly results? Affect my ability to deliver products, affect my\nrevenue, affect my cost, answer those kinds of questions. To answer those\nkind of questions, we have to -- and we have. We had to change our\ndatabase, fundamentally change our database so you can vectorize all data.\nThat's the form in which large language models understand information after\nit's been vectorized. And then allowing people to ask any question they\nwant about anything.\n\n\nAnd we -- that's exactly what we've done. But unless you have a database\nthat is secure and reliable and linked to all of the popular LLMs, and\nwe've done all of that, unless you have that and you have to tell me who\nelse has that besides Oracle. Unless you have that, it's going to be very\nhard for you to deliver a ChatGPT-like experience on top of your data as\nwell as publicly available data. That's a unique value proposition for\nOracle. And that's because, again, we're the custodian of all of much more\ndata than any of the application companies. They have their application\ndata. They measure their customers in tens of thousands. We measure our\ncustomers in millions of databases. So we think we're better positioned\nthan anybody to take advantage of inferencing.\n\n\nSafra Ada Catz\nCEO & Director\n\nBy the way, aside from just our GPU and all of that, we have become the de\nfacto cloud for many of our customers. Again, they want to put some things\nin our public cloud or in our competitors' public cloud working with the\nOracle database. But simultaneously, there are a lot of reasons why they\nwant what's called either a dedicated region or cloud a customer. We give\nour customers so much choice that there's very unusual for us not to be\nable to meet a customer's needs in one way or another.\n\n\nAnd then, of course, we have every piece of the stack. We have the\ninfrastructure. We have the database that you're going to hear a lot about\nas really the only reasonable store for data that you want to use AI models\nagainst. And then we have all of these applications that are just taking\noff. So we just have a lot of different layers. They're all moving in the\nsame direction, and they all benefit our customers when used together.\n\n\nLawrence J. Ellison\nCo-Founder, Chairman & CTO\n\nGo ahead. John, maybe you're going to compliment us and I interrupted you.\nWhat -- I mean so I apologize for being rude.\n\n\nJohn Stephen DiFucci\nGuggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division\n\nListen, I was just going to say my hat's off to both of you. I have been\ndoing this a really long time, and I tell my old team, pay attention to\nthis, even those that are not working on Oracle because this is a career\nevent happening right now, and it looks -- it's just amazing. And I guess\nI'm just really happy for you and congrats on this. It's amazing. But a lot\nof work keep doing it.\n\n\nLawrence J. Ellison\nCo-Founder, Chairman & CTO\n\nIt's been a lot of work. And let me mention 2 other things, I think, that\nare actually shocking. We have gotten the entire Oracle Cloud, the whole\nthing, every feature, every function of the Oracle Cloud down to something\nwe can put into a handful of racks, 3 racks, we call it Butterfly that cost\n$6 million. So we can give you a private version of the Oracle Cloud with\nevery feature, every security feature, every function, everything we do for\n$6 million. I think the cost for the other hyperscalers is more than 100x\nthat.\n\n\nSo we can actually give our customers clouded customer, the full cloud\ncustomer. And we have companies like Vodafone. And I'm not sure which\ncompanies I can name and which companies I can't. We have large companies\nthat are buying basically their own Oracle Cloud regions. In fact, multiple\nOracle Cloud regions because they don't want to have any neighbors in their\ncloud. They don't want other companies in their cloud, but they want the\nfull cloud. They want to pay as they consume, they want all the features,\nall the function, all the safety, the security. They don't want to have to\nbuy it. They want us to buy and own the software and the hardware. They\nwant us to maintain it, build the network to supply all of that, and they\njust want to pay for consumption. We can do that at an entry-level price\nthat's 1% of what our competitors can offer. That's one thing.\n\n\nAnother thing. Let me give you one more, and I'll stop there. We also have\nthe most advanced application generator of any company. It's interesting.\nWe're an application company and a cloud infrastructure company. And\ntherefore, we build applications. And as we build applications, we'd like\nto be more efficient. And the way to be more efficient is to build AI\napplication generators, and we have been doing that. And we -- the latest\napplications that we are building, we're not building them. They're being\ngenerated by AI. And we think we're far, far ahead of any of the other\napplication companies in terms of generating the applications. So that's\nanother very significant advantage we have. And of course -- and it's\nfunny, I made the comment that we don't charge separately for our AI and\nour applications because our applications are AI. They're entirely AI. The\nnew ones, the new ones that we're building, there are nothing other than a\nbunch of AI agents that we generate that are linked together with workflow.\nThat's all they are. How do you charge separately for that? That's every\napplication that we have. But the applications are better. And hopefully,\nwe'll sell more, and that's the way we'll get paid for them. Thank you,\nJohn, for the very nice compliments.\n\n\nSafra Ada Catz\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, John, for all these years following us so kindly also. Great\nday. Probably time for another question at this point.\n\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.\n\n\nBrad Alan Zelnick\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\n\nGreat. And I think we're all kind of in shock in a very, very good way.\nLarry, there's no better evidence of a seismic shift happening in computing\nthan these results that you just put up. And Oracle has a near 50-year\ntrack record of navigating transitions and coming out on top. But as we\nthink about enterprise applications, investors are fairly pessimistic these\ndays. And I'd love to hear your perspective, where do you see this all\ngoing for the industry? Where does the market share go to the companies\nthat don't have the database that don't have the advantages that you have\nall the way down to the silicon? Is this maybe an extinction event? I'd be\ncurious to hear what you think.\n\n\nLawrence J. Ellison\nCo-Founder, Chairman & CTO\n\nWell, I think we have substantial advantages because we are an\ninfrastructure company and we are an application company. There are 2\nthings that happen. As an application company, we needed -- we knew we had\nto start generating our applications. We just couldn't do it with armies of\npeople anymore. We still need people, don't get me wrong. But the number of\npeople we need is substantially less. And we can build/generate much better\napplications than we can hand build. And we've been working on these AI\napplication generators for some time, and we're actually using them.\n\n\nBut the thing is we're not just building application generators. We're\nbuilding application generators and then we're building the applications,\nwhich gives us insights to make the application generator better. It's a\nhuge advantage to be on both sides of that equation, both being an\napplication builder and a builder of the application generation technology,\nthe underlying AI application code generators. That's a huge advantage.\n\n\nLet me give you another advantage, which is often a disadvantage. We're\nvery large. We no longer sell individual discrete applications. We sell\nsuites of applications. We decided to go into the medical business against\nEpic, believing that we could solve much more of the problem because we're\nmuch bigger than they are. And by the way, we're much bigger than Workday\nand -- or ServiceNow. And we're solving a larger portion of the problem.\nWe're able to -- we're able to do all of ERP, then we can add all of CRM,\nbut all the pieces are engineered to fit together. That makes it so much\neasier for customers to consume.\n\n\nSo we think that -- being good at application generation, the underlying\ntechnology makes us better -- build better applications, enables us to\nbuild more applications so we can solve more of the problem. So the\ncustomers don't have to do all that system integration across multiple\nvendors. We can just build a suite where all the pieces are engineered to\nfit together. I think we have tremendous advantages in the application\nspace. We have tremendous advantages in the AI inferencing space where we\ncan -- again, what we'll demonstrate at Oracle AI World next month is we've\ntaken all of our customer data, all of it. I want to go into all the\ndetails now.\n\n\nBut you can ask any question you want to ask. Who's your salesperson? Who's\nthe #1 prospect in my territory? What products should I be selling them\nnext? What are the reference -- what are the best references for me to use\nto persuade them to use our product. You can get all of those questions\nanswered for you immediately if you're a salesperson. The engineers can\nlook at which features of Oracle Financials are people making the most\nerrors when they're using those features that I have to fix and make easier\nto use. You just ask the question because all of that data is available to\nAI models. We're the only -- is there anyone else doing this? Not that I\nknow of.\n\n\nBrad Alan Zelnick\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\n\nLooking forward to the AI world, Larry. It's an amazing day for Oracle.\nIt's a remarkable day for the industry.\n\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with TD Cowen.\n\n\nJames Derrick  Wood\nTD Cowen, Research Division\n\nGreat. I'll echo my congratulations on this momentous quarter. Safra, I\nmean, the fact that you delivered over $300 billion of new RPO in Q1, just\nreally amazing to see, but it's going to require a lot of infrastructure\nbuild-out. So could you provide a bit more context on how much CapEx and\noperational cost structure will be needed to fully service these contracts?\nHow we should think about the ramp of these costs relative to the ramp in\nrevenue over the next few years? And generally, how investors should be\nthinking about the ROI on the spend?\n\n\nSafra Ada Catz\nCEO & Director\n\nSure. So first of all, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, and as I've\nsaid very clearly beforehand, we do not own the property. We do not own the\nbuildings. What we do own and what we engineer is the equipment. And that's\nequipment that is optimized for the Oracle Cloud. It has extremely special\nnetworking capabilities. It has technical capabilities from Larry and his\nteam that allows us to run these workloads much, much faster. And as a\nresult, it's much cheaper than our competitors. and depending on the\nworkload.\n\n\nNow because of that, what we do is we put in that equipment only when it's\ntime and usually very quickly, assuming that our customer accepts it, we're\nalready generating revenue right away. The faster they accept the system\nand that it meets their needs, the faster they start using it, the sooner\nwe have revenue. This is, in some ways, I don't want to call it asset-light\nfrom the finance world, but it's asset pretty light. And that is really an\nadvantage for us. I know some of our competitors, they like to own\nbuildings. That's not really our specialty. Our specialty is the unique\ntechnology, the unique networking, the storage, just the whole way we put\nthese systems together.\n\n\nAnd by the way, they are identical and very simplified and again, making it\npossible for us to be very profitable while still being able to offer our\ncustomers an incredibly compelling price. What I have indicated is that\nCapEx looks like it's going to be about $35 billion for this fiscal year.\nBut because we're monitoring this, we're literally putting it in right when\nwe take possession and then handing it over to generate revenue right away.\nSo we're very -- we have a very good line of sight for our capabilities to\nput this out and to -- and basically to just spend on that CapEx right\nbefore it starts generating revenue.\n\n\nBut at this point, I'm looking at $35 billion for the year. And I think --\nI mean, it could be a little higher, but I think -- and if it is higher,\nit's good news because it means more capacity has been handed over to me in\nterms of floor space. And as you also know, we are embedded in our\ncompetitors' cloud, again, all we are responsible for to pay for is, in\nfact, our equipment, and that goes right away. And there, we're moving\nultimately to 71 data centers embedded in our competitors or flash\npartners.\n\n\nLawrence J. Ellison\nCo-Founder, Chairman & CTO\n\nLet me add a couple of very short things. One is we just turned over a\ngiant data hall to one of our customers. And the acceptance time could have\nbeen as long as a couple of months. It was 1 week. It was 1 week from the\ntime we owned -- officially owned the equipment, and they were testing it\nto the time they started paying for it, 1 week. So we have an extraordinary\nteam that's doing an extraordinary job of making sure that we get the\nequipment working very quickly and our customers can accept it. They want\nto accept it as fast as possible because they want to do the work. They\nwant to train their models.\n\n\nAnd this one took a huge haul, took 1 week for acceptance. It was\nextraordinary that -- the other, we are a very large consumer of networking\nequipment, GPUs, et cetera. Because we are a very large consumer, we are\nable, I think, to get better financing terms from the vendors than some of\ntheir people. So I think we have that going for us as well. I think we're\ngoing to do very well on the finance side. We have advantages there as\nwell.\n\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein\nResearch.\n\n\nMark L. Moerdler\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\n\nLarry and Safra and frankly, team Oracle, amazing congratulations. I'd like\nto focus on the AI training business you've been winning. Could you please\nexplain to us how Oracle can create enough of a differentiated moat to\nassure this business does not get commoditized? And how do you continue to\ndrive strong earnings and free cash flow from the training business even if\ntraining slows? I think people really need to understand that.\n\n\nLawrence J. Ellison\nCo-Founder, Chairman & CTO\n\nWell, let me -- I mean, I can do it with one sentence. Our networks move\ndata very, very fast. And if we can move data faster than the other people,\nif we have advantages in our GPU superclusters that are performance\nadvantages, if you're paying by the hour, if we're twice as fast, we're\nhalf the cost.\n\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\n\n\nAleksandr J. Zukin\nWolfe Research, LLC\n\nI really appreciate you squeezing me in. I originally was going to ask you\nif the new Oracle AI database really opens up the general enterprise\ninferencing market. And based on your script, it sounds like the answer to\nthat question is hell yes. So I guess my follow-up question would be, how\ndo you see that pacing happening over the course of the next few years? How\nsoon after the introduction of the Oracle AI database, would you expect\nyour enterprise customers, your sophisticated customers to really be open\nto interrogating their enterprise data in this fashion? And how does the\ncurrent supply-constrained environment stand in the way of that demand? Or\nis it solving as we speak?\n\n\nSafra Ada Catz\nCEO & Director\n\nI don't know if, Larry, you want to cover it. You covered it\n[indiscernible] mark. Go ahead.\n\n\nLawrence J. Ellison\nCo-Founder, Chairman & CTO\n\nOkay. I think who wouldn't want that? I mean I think everyone says they\nwant to use AI. I mean every -- I mean, CEOs say they want to use AI. heads\nof state, heads of government say they want to use AI. We've never had\nconsumers like that. I mean we -- historically, we don't deal with CEOs.\nNow we deal with CEOs. Now we deal with heads of government and heads of\nstate on this because AI is so important. And letting people have -- use AI\non top of their data, that is what they want to do. But they didn't know\nhow to do it securely. They didn't know how to -- well, they didn't know\nhow to do it, period. And one of the big risks was, oh my God, I can't\nshare my -- JPMorgan Chase can't share all of its data. Goldman Sachs can't\nshare all of its data with OpenAI, they won't do it. So -- or xAI or Lama\nor Meta, they won't -- it's got to keep it private.\n\n\nSo we've got to keep your private data private. We've got to keep your\nprivate data secure. But we have to make it available for inferencing by\nthe latest and best reasoning models from OpenAI and xAI and everyone else.\nAnd we've -- because we have the database, because we can vectorize all the\ndata in the database, because we have very elaborate security models in our\ndatabase, in the Oracle database. We can do all that. We can deliver all\nthat. And then what we chose to do was to -- with the AI database was not\nonly make sure we can vectorize all the data, so it can be understood by\nthe AI model, we then bundled it with all of the AI models. That's why we\ndid a deal with Google. That's why we did all of these deals where Gemini,\nyou can get Gemini from the Oracle Cloud. You can get Brock from the Oracle\nCloud. You can get ChatGPT from the Oracle Cloud. You get Lama from the\nOracle Cloud, I can go on.\n\n\nSo we bundled them together. So it's very easy for our customers to use\nthese large language models on a combination. And that's what they want.\nIt's a combination of all of the publicly available data and all of their\nenterprise data, which allows them to ask and get answered any question\nthey can think of any question that's important to them. Everyone wants it.\nI think the demand is going to be insatiable. But we can deliver a lot of\ndatabases and a lot of AI across our cloud over the next several years.\nWe're in a good position to do that.\n\n\nSafra Ada Catz\nCEO & Director\n\nAnd this is going to be one of the reasons that Oracle databases, which are\nstill the bulk of the enterprise market by a lot are going to finally move\ninto the cloud. Many of them will move in the public cloud using the Oracle\nAI database. But many and the largest enterprises will want their own\neither dedicated regions or Oracle Cloud customer. And again, they can\nfinally get the benefit of AI for their own data using any LLM that they\nwant because they're all in our cloud, too.\n\n\nAleksandr J. Zukin\nWolfe Research, LLC\n\nIt sounds like very high-margin AI revenue, guys. Congratulations.\n\n\nSafra Ada Catz\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you.\n\n\nKen  Bond\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Alex. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available\nfor 24 hours on our Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us\ntoday. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Tiffany for closing.\n\n\nOperatorLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you all\nfor joining.

  "presentation_text": "Operator\n\nHello, and thank you for standing by. My name is Tiffany, and I will be\nyour conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome\neveryone to the Oracle Corporation Q1 FY 2026 Conference Call.\n\n\n[Operator Instructions]\n\n\nI would now like to turn the call over to Ken Bond, Head of Investor\nRelations. Ken, please go ahead.\n\n\nKen  Bond\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Tiffany. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's First\nQuarter Fiscal Year 2026 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press\nrelease and financial tables, which include a GAAP to non-GAAP\nreconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed\nand downloaded from our Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of\nmany customers who purchased Oracle Cloud Services or went live on Oracle\nCloud recently will be available from the Investor Relations website. On\nthe call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison;\nand Chief Executive Officer, Safra Catz.\n\n\nAs a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements,\nincluding predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that\nmight be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will\npresent some important factors relating to our business, which may include\n-- which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These\nforward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that\nmay cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made\ntoday. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these\nforward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent\nreports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a\ncomplete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our\nfuture results or the market price of our stock.\n\n\nAnd finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these\nforward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.\nBefore taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks.\n\n\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.\n\n\nSafra Ada Catz\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Clearly, we had an amazing start\nto the year because Oracle has become the go-to place for AI workloads. We\nhave signed significant cloud contracts with the who's who of AI, including\nOpenAI, xAI, Meta, NVIDIA, AMD and many others. At the end of Q1, remaining\nperformance obligations, or RPO, now to $455 billion. This is up 359% from\nlast year and up $317 billion from the end of Q4. Our cloud RPO grew nearly\n500% on top of 83% growth last year.\n\n\nNow to the results using constant currency growth rate. As you can see,\nwe've made some changes to the face of our income statement to better\nreflect how we manage the business and so you can understand our cloud\nbusiness dynamics more directly. So here goes. Total cloud revenue, that's\nboth Apps and Infrastructure was up 27% to $7.2 billion. Cloud\ninfrastructure revenue was $3.3 billion, up 54% on top of the 46% growth\nreported in Q1 last year. OCI consumption revenue was up [ 57% ] and demand\ncontinues to dramatically outstrip supply. Cloud database services, which\nwere up 32%, now have annualized revenues of nearly $2.8 billion.\nAutonomous Database revenue was up 43% on top of the 26% growth reported in\nQ1 last year. Multi-cloud database revenue, where OCI regions are embedded\nin AWS, Azure and GCP grew 1,529% in Q1.\n\n\nCloud application revenue was $3.8 billion and up 10%, while our strategic\nback-office application revenue was $2.4 billion, up 16%. Total software\nrevenue for the quarter was $5.7 billion, down 2%. So all in, total\nrevenues for the quarter were $14.9 billion, up 11% from last year and\nhigher than the 8% growth reported in Q1 last year. Operating income grew\n7% to $6.2 billion. We have also been on an accelerated journey to adopt AI\ninternally to run more efficiently. I expect our operating income will grow\nmid-teens this year and higher still in FY '27. Non-GAAP EPS was USD 1.47\nin U.S. dollars, while GAAP EPS was USD 1.01 in U.S. dollars. The non-GAAP\ntax rate for the quarter was 20.5%, which was higher than the 19% guidance\nand caused EPS to be $0.03 lower. For the last 4 quarters, operating cash\nflow was up 13% to $21.5 billion, and free cash flow was a negative $5.9\nbillion with $27.4 billion of CapEx. Operating cash flow for Q1 was $8.1\nbillion, while free cash flow was a negative $362 million with CapEx of\n$8.5 billion.\n\n\nAt quarter end, we had $11 billion in cash and marketable securities and\nshort-term deferred revenue balance was $12 billion, up 5%. Over the last\n10 years, we've reduced the shares outstanding by 1/3 at an average price\nof $55, which is, at this point, much less than 1/4 of our current stock\nprice. This quarter, we repurchased 440,000 shares for a total of $95\nmillion. In addition, we paid out dividends of $5 billion over the last 12\nmonths, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of\n$0.50 per share. Given our RPO growth, I now expect fiscal year '26 CapEx\nwill be around $35 billion. As a reminder, the vast majority of our CapEx\ninvestments are for revenue-generating equipment that is going into the\ndata centers and not for land or buildings. As we bring more capacity\nonline, we will convert the large RPO backlog into accelerating revenue and\nprofit growth.\n\n\nNow before I dive into specific Q2 guidance, I'd like to share some of the\noverarching thoughts on fiscal year '26 and the coming years. Clearly, it\nwas an excellent quarter and demand for Oracle Cloud infrastructure\ncontinues to build. I expect we will sign additional multibillion-dollar\ncustomers and that RPO will likely grow to exceed $0.5 trillion. The\nenormity of this RPO growth enables us to make a large upward revision to\nthe cloud infrastructure portion of our financial plan. We now expect\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure will grow 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year\nand then increase to $32 billion, $73 billion, $114 billion and $144\nbillion over the following 4 years. Much of this revenue is already booked\nin our $455 billion RPO number, and we are off to a fantastic start this\nyear.\n\n\nNow while much attention is focused on our GPU-related business, our non-\nGPU infrastructure business continues to grow much faster than our\ncompetitors. We are also seeing our industry-specific cloud applications\ndrive customers to our back-office cloud apps. And finally, the Oracle\ndatabase is booming with 34 multi-cloud data centers now live inside of\nAzure, GCP and AWS, and we will deliver another 37 data centers for a total\nof 71. All these trends point to revenue growth going higher.\n\n\nFor fiscal year 2026, we remain confident and committed to full year total\nrevenue growth of 16% in constant currency. Beyond fiscal year '26, I'm\neven more confident in our ability to further accelerate our top and bottom\nline growth rate. As mentioned, we will provide an update on our long-range\nfinancial targets at our Financial Analyst Meeting at Oracle AI World in\nLas Vegas in October.\n\n\nNow let me turn to my guidance for Q2, which I'll review on a non-GAAP\nbasis and assuming currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now.\nCurrency should have a $0.03 positive impact on EPS and a 1% positive\neffect on revenue, depending on rounding. However, the actual currency\nimpact may be different as it was in Q1. Here goes. Total revenue are\nexpected to grow from 12% to 14% in constant currency and are expected to\ngrow from 14% to 16% in U.S. dollars at today's exchange rate. Total cloud\nrevenue is expected to grow from 32% to 36% in constant currency and is\nexpected to grow from 33% to 37% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow\nbetween 8% to 10% and between -- be between $1.58 and $1.62 in constant\ncurrency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow 10% to 12% and be between USD\n$1.61 and USD 1.65. And lastly, my EPS guidance for Q2 assumes a base tax\nrate of 19%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates to\nvary as they did this quarter.\n\n\nLarry, over to you.\n\n\nLawrence J. Ellison\nCo-Founder, Chairman & CTO\n\nThank you, Safra. Eventually, AI will change everything. But right now, AI\nis fundamentally transforming Oracle and the rest of the computer industry,\nthough not everyone fully grasp the extent of the tsunami that is\napproaching. Look at our quarterly numbers. Some things are undeniably\nevident. Several world-class AI companies have chosen Oracle to build large-\nscale GPU-centric data centers to train their AI models. That's because\nOracle builds gigawatt scale data centers that are faster and more cost\nefficient at training AI models than anyone else in the world. Training AI\nmodels is a gigantic multitrillion-dollar market. It's hard to conceive of\na technology market as large as that one. But if you look close, you can\nfind one that's even larger. And it's the market for AI inferencing.\nMillions of customers using those AI models to run businesses and\ngovernments. In fact, the AI inferencing market will be much, much larger\nthan the AI training market.\n\n\nAI inferencing will be used to run robotic factories, robotic cars, robotic\ngreenhouses, biomolecular simulations for drug design, interpreting medical\ndiagnostic images and laboratory results, automating laboratories, placing\nbets in financial markets, automating legal processes, automating financial\nprocesses, automating sales processes. AI is going to write that is\ngenerate the computer programs called AI agents. That will automate your\nsales and marketing processes. Let me repeat that. AI is going to\nautomatically write the computer programs that will then automate your\nsales processes and your legal processes and everything else and in your\nfactories and so on. Think about it. AI inferencing, it's AI inferencing\nthat will change everything. Oracle is aggressively pursuing the AI. And\nwe're not doing badly in the AI training market, by the way. With\ninferencing figure, oracle is aggressively pursuing the inferencing market\nas well as the AI training market.\n\n\nWe think we are in a pretty good position to be a winner in the inferencing\nmarket because Oracle is by far the world's largest custodian of high-value\nprivate enterprise data. With the introduction of our new AI database, we\nadded a very important new way for you to store your data in our database.\nYou can vectorize it. And by vectorizing it, by vectorizing all your data,\nall your data can be understood by AI models. Then we made it very easy for\nour customers to directly connect all their databases, all their new Oracle\nAI databases and cloud storage, OCI Cloud storage to the world's most\nadvanced AI reasoning models, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Llama, all of which\nare uniquely available in the Oracle Cloud. After you vectorize your data\nand link it to an LLM, the LLM of your choice, you can then ask any\nquestion you can think of.\n\n\nFor example, how will the latest tariffs impact next quarter's revenue and\nprofit? You asked that question, the large language model will then apply\nadvanced reasoning to the combination of your private enterprise data plus\npublicly available data. you get answers to important questions without\never compromising the safety and security of your private data. Again, I'd\nlike you to think about this for a moment. A lot of companies are saying,\nwe're big into AI because we're writing agents. Well, guess what, we're\nwriting a bunch of agents, too. But when they introduced ChatGPT almost 3\nyears ago, what you got to do is have a conversation and ask questions. You\ndidn't -- you weren't automating some process with an agent. You could ask\nwhatever question you wanted to ask and get a well-reasoned answer with all\nof the latest and best information and high-quality reason go along with\nit.\n\n\nWho's offering that to customers? We'll be the first when we deliver it and\ndemonstrate it at AI World next month. That's what our customers have been\nasking for ever since the introduction of ChatGPT 3.5 almost 3 years ago. I\nwant to ask questions about anything. And therefore, you need to understand\nmy enterprise data as well as all the publicly available data. Then you can\nanswer the questions that are most important to me.\nWell, now they can ask those questions. Back to you, Safra.",
  "qa_text": "Ken  Bond\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Larry. Tiffany, please pull the audience for questions.\n\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Instructions]\n\n\nYour first question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Guggenheim\nSecurities.\n\n\nJohn Stephen DiFucci\nGuggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division\n\nListen, even I am sort of blown away by what this looks like going forward.\nAnd this question, I guess, is sort of purposely open-ended. So Larry and\nSafra, Oracle has become the de facto standard for AI training workloads\nand you make money at it and I have a lot of faith in that. But clearly,\nthere's more here than just AI training. I know it's a big part of it. You\ntalked about it. But can you talk about what else -- a little more detail\nabout what else is driving these pretty amazing forecasts?\n\n\nSafra Ada Catz\nCEO & Director\n\nGo ahead, Larry. I think you were covering this.\n\n\nLawrence J. Ellison\nCo-Founder, Chairman & CTO\n\nYes. Well, it's -- a lot of people are looking for inferencing capacity. I\nmean people are running out of inferencing capacity. I mean the company\nthat called us -- I mentioned it, I think either last quarter or the\nquarter before, someone called us, we'll take all the capacity you have\nthat's currently not being used anywhere in the world. We don't care. And\nI've never gotten a call like that. That's a very unusual call. That was\nfor inferencing, not training. There is a huge amount of demand for\ninferencing. And if you think about it, in the end, all this money we're\nspending on training is going to have to be translated into products that\nare sold, which is all inferencing.\n\n\nAnd the inferencing market, again, is much larger than the training market.\nAnd yes, we are building -- like everybody else, we're building agents with\nour applications. But we're doing much more than that. No one's shown me a\nChatGPT 3.5, again, 3 years ago, 3.5 -- 3 years ago, a little less than 3\nyears ago, when the ChatGPT amazed the world, and you could simply talk to\nyour computer and ask questions and get well reasoned well questions based\non the latest and most precise information as long as you ask those\nquestions about publicly available data, and there's a lot of publicly\navailable data.\n\n\nBut if you combine the publicly available data with the enterprise data,\nwhich companies really don't want to share, you have to do it in such a way\nthat your private enterprise data stays private, yet the large language\nmodel can still use it for reasoning so as to answer your question, like\nhow do the latest tariffs or the latest steel prices or whatever affect my\nquarterly results? Affect my ability to deliver products, affect my\nrevenue, affect my cost, answer those kinds of questions. To answer those\nkind of questions, we have to -- and we have. We had to change our\ndatabase, fundamentally change our database so you can vectorize all data.\nThat's the form in which large language models understand information after\nit's been vectorized. And then allowing people to ask any question they\nwant about anything.\n\n\nAnd we -- that's exactly what we've done. But unless you have a database\nthat is secure and reliable and linked to all of the popular LLMs, and\nwe've done all of that, unless you have that and you have to tell me who\nelse has that besides Oracle. Unless you have that, it's going to be very\nhard for you to deliver a ChatGPT-like experience on top of your data as\nwell as publicly available data. That's a unique value proposition for\nOracle. And that's because, again, we're the custodian of all of much more\ndata than any of the application companies. They have their application\ndata. They measure their customers in tens of thousands. We measure our\ncustomers in millions of databases. So we think we're better positioned\nthan anybody to take advantage of inferencing.\n\n\nSafra Ada Catz\nCEO & Director\n\nBy the way, aside from just our GPU and all of that, we have become the de\nfacto cloud for many of our customers. Again, they want to put some things\nin our public cloud or in our competitors' public cloud working with the\nOracle database. But simultaneously, there are a lot of reasons why they\nwant what's called either a dedicated region or cloud a customer. We give\nour customers so much choice that there's very unusual for us not to be\nable to meet a customer's needs in one way or another.\n\n\nAnd then, of course, we have every piece of the stack. We have the\ninfrastructure. We have the database that you're going to hear a lot about\nas really the only reasonable store for data that you want to use AI models\nagainst. And then we have all of these applications that are just taking\noff. So we just have a lot of different layers. They're all moving in the\nsame direction, and they all benefit our customers when used together.\n\n\nLawrence J. Ellison\nCo-Founder, Chairman & CTO\n\nGo ahead. John, maybe you're going to compliment us and I interrupted you.\nWhat -- I mean so I apologize for being rude.\n\n\nJohn Stephen DiFucci\nGuggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division\n\nListen, I was just going to say my hat's off to both of you. I have been\ndoing this a really long time, and I tell my old team, pay attention to\nthis, even those that are not working on Oracle because this is a career\nevent happening right now, and it looks -- it's just amazing. And I guess\nI'm just really happy for you and congrats on this. It's amazing. But a lot\nof work keep doing it.\n\n\nLawrence J. Ellison\nCo-Founder, Chairman & CTO\n\nIt's been a lot of work. And let me mention 2 other things, I think, that\nare actually shocking. We have gotten the entire Oracle Cloud, the whole\nthing, every feature, every function of the Oracle Cloud down to something\nwe can put into a handful of racks, 3 racks, we call it Butterfly that cost\n$6 million. So we can give you a private version of the Oracle Cloud with\nevery feature, every security feature, every function, everything we do for\n$6 million. I think the cost for the other hyperscalers is more than 100x\nthat.\n\n\nSo we can actually give our customers clouded customer, the full cloud\ncustomer. And we have companies like Vodafone. And I'm not sure which\ncompanies I can name and which companies I can't. We have large companies\nthat are buying basically their own Oracle Cloud regions. In fact, multiple\nOracle Cloud regions because they don't want to have any neighbors in their\ncloud. They don't want other companies in their cloud, but they want the\nfull cloud. They want to pay as they consume, they want all the features,\nall the function, all the safety, the security. They don't want to have to\nbuy it. They want us to buy and own the software and the hardware. They\nwant us to maintain it, build the network to supply all of that, and they\njust want to pay for consumption. We can do that at an entry-level price\nthat's 1% of what our competitors can offer. That's one thing.\n\n\nAnother thing. Let me give you one more, and I'll stop there. We also have\nthe most advanced application generator of any company. It's interesting.\nWe're an application company and a cloud infrastructure company. And\ntherefore, we build applications. And as we build applications, we'd like\nto be more efficient. And the way to be more efficient is to build AI\napplication generators, and we have been doing that. And we -- the latest\napplications that we are building, we're not building them. They're being\ngenerated by AI. And we think we're far, far ahead of any of the other\napplication companies in terms of generating the applications. So that's\nanother very significant advantage we have. And of course -- and it's\nfunny, I made the comment that we don't charge separately for our AI and\nour applications because our applications are AI. They're entirely AI. The\nnew ones, the new ones that we're building, there are nothing other than a\nbunch of AI agents that we generate that are linked together with workflow.\nThat's all they are. How do you charge separately for that? That's every\napplication that we have. But the applications are better. And hopefully,\nwe'll sell more, and that's the way we'll get paid for them. Thank you,\nJohn, for the very nice compliments.\n\n\nSafra Ada Catz\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, John, for all these years following us so kindly also. Great\nday. Probably time for another question at this point.\n\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.\n\n\nBrad Alan Zelnick\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\n\nGreat. And I think we're all kind of in shock in a very, very good way.\nLarry, there's no better evidence of a seismic shift happening in computing\nthan these results that you just put up. And Oracle has a near 50-year\ntrack record of navigating transitions and coming out on top. But as we\nthink about enterprise applications, investors are fairly pessimistic these\ndays. And I'd love to hear your perspective, where do you see this all\ngoing for the industry? Where does the market share go to the companies\nthat don't have the database that don't have the advantages that you have\nall the way down to the silicon? Is this maybe an extinction event? I'd be\ncurious to hear what you think.\n\n\nLawrence J. Ellison\nCo-Founder, Chairman & CTO\n\nWell, I think we have substantial advantages because we are an\ninfrastructure company and we are an application company. There are 2\nthings that happen. As an application company, we needed -- we knew we had\nto start generating our applications. We just couldn't do it with armies of\npeople anymore. We still need people, don't get me wrong. But the number of\npeople we need is substantially less. And we can build/generate much better\napplications than we can hand build. And we've been working on these AI\napplication generators for some time, and we're actually using them.\n\n\nBut the thing is we're not just building application generators. We're\nbuilding application generators and then we're building the applications,\nwhich gives us insights to make the application generator better. It's a\nhuge advantage to be on both sides of that equation, both being an\napplication builder and a builder of the application generation technology,\nthe underlying AI application code generators. That's a huge advantage.\n\n\nLet me give you another advantage, which is often a disadvantage. We're\nvery large. We no longer sell individual discrete applications. We sell\nsuites of applications. We decided to go into the medical business against\nEpic, believing that we could solve much more of the problem because we're\nmuch bigger than they are. And by the way, we're much bigger than Workday\nand -- or ServiceNow. And we're solving a larger portion of the problem.\nWe're able to -- we're able to do all of ERP, then we can add all of CRM,\nbut all the pieces are engineered to fit together. That makes it so much\neasier for customers to consume.\n\n\nSo we think that -- being good at application generation, the underlying\ntechnology makes us better -- build better applications, enables us to\nbuild more applications so we can solve more of the problem. So the\ncustomers don't have to do all that system integration across multiple\nvendors. We can just build a suite where all the pieces are engineered to\nfit together. I think we have tremendous advantages in the application\nspace. We have tremendous advantages in the AI inferencing space where we\ncan -- again, what we'll demonstrate at Oracle AI World next month is we've\ntaken all of our customer data, all of it. I want to go into all the\ndetails now.\n\n\nBut you can ask any question you want to ask. Who's your salesperson? Who's\nthe #1 prospect in my territory? What products should I be selling them\nnext? What are the reference -- what are the best references for me to use\nto persuade them to use our product. You can get all of those questions\nanswered for you immediately if you're a salesperson. The engineers can\nlook at which features of Oracle Financials are people making the most\nerrors when they're using those features that I have to fix and make easier\nto use. You just ask the question because all of that data is available to\nAI models. We're the only -- is there anyone else doing this? Not that I\nknow of.\n\n\nBrad Alan Zelnick\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\n\nLooking forward to the AI world, Larry. It's an amazing day for Oracle.\nIt's a remarkable day for the industry.\n\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with TD Cowen.\n\n\nJames Derrick  Wood\nTD Cowen, Research Division\n\nGreat. I'll echo my congratulations on this momentous quarter. Safra, I\nmean, the fact that you delivered over $300 billion of new RPO in Q1, just\nreally amazing to see, but it's going to require a lot of infrastructure\nbuild-out. So could you provide a bit more context on how much CapEx and\noperational cost structure will be needed to fully service these contracts?\nHow we should think about the ramp of these costs relative to the ramp in\nrevenue over the next few years? And generally, how investors should be\nthinking about the ROI on the spend?\n\n\nSafra Ada Catz\nCEO & Director\n\nSure. So first of all, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, and as I've\nsaid very clearly beforehand, we do not own the property. We do not own the\nbuildings. What we do own and what we engineer is the equipment. And that's\nequipment that is optimized for the Oracle Cloud. It has extremely special\nnetworking capabilities. It has technical capabilities from Larry and his\nteam that allows us to run these workloads much, much faster. And as a\nresult, it's much cheaper than our competitors. and depending on the\nworkload.\n\n\nNow because of that, what we do is we put in that equipment only when it's\ntime and usually very quickly, assuming that our customer accepts it, we're\nalready generating revenue right away. The faster they accept the system\nand that it meets their needs, the faster they start using it, the sooner\nwe have revenue. This is, in some ways, I don't want to call it asset-light\nfrom the finance world, but it's asset pretty light. And that is really an\nadvantage for us. I know some of our competitors, they like to own\nbuildings. That's not really our specialty. Our specialty is the unique\ntechnology, the unique networking, the storage, just the whole way we put\nthese systems together.\n\n\nAnd by the way, they are identical and very simplified and again, making it\npossible for us to be very profitable while still being able to offer our\ncustomers an incredibly compelling price. What I have indicated is that\nCapEx looks like it's going to be about $35 billion for this fiscal year.\nBut because we're monitoring this, we're literally putting it in right when\nwe take possession and then handing it over to generate revenue right away.\nSo we're very -- we have a very good line of sight for our capabilities to\nput this out and to -- and basically to just spend on that CapEx right\nbefore it starts generating revenue.\n\n\nBut at this point, I'm looking at $35 billion for the year. And I think --\nI mean, it could be a little higher, but I think -- and if it is higher,\nit's good news because it means more capacity has been handed over to me in\nterms of floor space. And as you also know, we are embedded in our\ncompetitors' cloud, again, all we are responsible for to pay for is, in\nfact, our equipment, and that goes right away. And there, we're moving\nultimately to 71 data centers embedded in our competitors or flash\npartners.\n\n\nLawrence J. Ellison\nCo-Founder, Chairman & CTO\n\nLet me add a couple of very short things. One is we just turned over a\ngiant data hall to one of our customers. And the acceptance time could have\nbeen as long as a couple of months. It was 1 week. It was 1 week from the\ntime we owned -- officially owned the equipment, and they were testing it\nto the time they started paying for it, 1 week. So we have an extraordinary\nteam that's doing an extraordinary job of making sure that we get the\nequipment working very quickly and our customers can accept it. They want\nto accept it as fast as possible because they want to do the work. They\nwant to train their models.\n\n\nAnd this one took a huge haul, took 1 week for acceptance. It was\nextraordinary that -- the other, we are a very large consumer of networking\nequipment, GPUs, et cetera. Because we are a very large consumer, we are\nable, I think, to get better financing terms from the vendors than some of\ntheir people. So I think we have that going for us as well. I think we're\ngoing to do very well on the finance side. We have advantages there as\nwell.\n\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein\nResearch.\n\n\nMark L. Moerdler\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\n\nLarry and Safra and frankly, team Oracle, amazing congratulations. I'd like\nto focus on the AI training business you've been winning. Could you please\nexplain to us how Oracle can create enough of a differentiated moat to\nassure this business does not get commoditized? And how do you continue to\ndrive strong earnings and free cash flow from the training business even if\ntraining slows? I think people really need to understand that.\n\n\nLawrence J. Ellison\nCo-Founder, Chairman & CTO\n\nWell, let me -- I mean, I can do it with one sentence. Our networks move\ndata very, very fast. And if we can move data faster than the other people,\nif we have advantages in our GPU superclusters that are performance\nadvantages, if you're paying by the hour, if we're twice as fast, we're\nhalf the cost.\n\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\n\n\nAleksandr J. Zukin\nWolfe Research, LLC\n\nI really appreciate you squeezing me in. I originally was going to ask you\nif the new Oracle AI database really opens up the general enterprise\ninferencing market. And based on your script, it sounds like the answer to\nthat question is hell yes. So I guess my follow-up question would be, how\ndo you see that pacing happening over the course of the next few years? How\nsoon after the introduction of the Oracle AI database, would you expect\nyour enterprise customers, your sophisticated customers to really be open\nto interrogating their enterprise data in this fashion? And how does the\ncurrent supply-constrained environment stand in the way of that demand? Or\nis it solving as we speak?\n\n\nSafra Ada Catz\nCEO & Director\n\nI don't know if, Larry, you want to cover it. You covered it\n[indiscernible] mark. Go ahead.\n\n\nLawrence J. Ellison\nCo-Founder, Chairman & CTO\n\nOkay. I think who wouldn't want that? I mean I think everyone says they\nwant to use AI. I mean every -- I mean, CEOs say they want to use AI. heads\nof state, heads of government say they want to use AI. We've never had\nconsumers like that. I mean we -- historically, we don't deal with CEOs.\nNow we deal with CEOs. Now we deal with heads of government and heads of\nstate on this because AI is so important. And letting people have -- use AI\non top of their data, that is what they want to do. But they didn't know\nhow to do it securely. They didn't know how to -- well, they didn't know\nhow to do it, period. And one of the big risks was, oh my God, I can't\nshare my -- JPMorgan Chase can't share all of its data. Goldman Sachs can't\nshare all of its data with OpenAI, they won't do it. So -- or xAI or Lama\nor Meta, they won't -- it's got to keep it private.\n\n\nSo we've got to keep your private data private. We've got to keep your\nprivate data secure. But we have to make it available for inferencing by\nthe latest and best reasoning models from OpenAI and xAI and everyone else.\nAnd we've -- because we have the database, because we can vectorize all the\ndata in the database, because we have very elaborate security models in our\ndatabase, in the Oracle database. We can do all that. We can deliver all\nthat. And then what we chose to do was to -- with the AI database was not\nonly make sure we can vectorize all the data, so it can be understood by\nthe AI model, we then bundled it with all of the AI models. That's why we\ndid a deal with Google. That's why we did all of these deals where Gemini,\nyou can get Gemini from the Oracle Cloud. You can get Brock from the Oracle\nCloud. You can get ChatGPT from the Oracle Cloud. You get Lama from the\nOracle Cloud, I can go on.\n\n\nSo we bundled them together. So it's very easy for our customers to use\nthese large language models on a combination. And that's what they want.\nIt's a combination of all of the publicly available data and all of their\nenterprise data, which allows them to ask and get answered any question\nthey can think of any question that's important to them. Everyone wants it.\nI think the demand is going to be insatiable. But we can deliver a lot of\ndatabases and a lot of AI across our cloud over the next several years.\nWe're in a good position to do that.\n\n\nSafra Ada Catz\nCEO & Director\n\nAnd this is going to be one of the reasons that Oracle databases, which are\nstill the bulk of the enterprise market by a lot are going to finally move\ninto the cloud. Many of them will move in the public cloud using the Oracle\nAI database. But many and the largest enterprises will want their own\neither dedicated regions or Oracle Cloud customer. And again, they can\nfinally get the benefit of AI for their own data using any LLM that they\nwant because they're all in our cloud, too.\n\n\nAleksandr J. Zukin\nWolfe Research, LLC\n\nIt sounds like very high-margin AI revenue, guys.

      "text": "CEO & Director Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Clearly, we had an amazing start to the year because Oracle has become the go-to place for AI workloads. We have signed significant cloud contracts with the who's who of AI, including OpenAI, xAI, Meta, NVIDIA, AMD and many others. At the end of Q1, remaining performance obligations, or RPO, now to $455 billion. This is up 359% from last year and up $317 billion from the end of Q4. Our cloud RPO grew nearly 500% on top of 83% growth last year. Now to the results using constant currency growth rate. As you can see, we've made some changes to the face of our income statement to better reflect how we manage the business and so you can understand our cloud business dynamics more directly. So here goes. Total cloud revenue, that's both Apps and Infrastructure was up 27% to $7.2 billion. Cloud infrastructure revenue was $3.3 billion, up 54% on top of the 46% growth reported in Q1 last year. OCI consumption revenue was up [ 57% ] and demand continues to dramatically outstrip supply. Cloud database services, which were up 32%, now have annualized revenues of nearly $2.8 billion. Autonomous Database revenue was up 43% on top of the 26% growth reported in Q1 last year. Multi-cloud database revenue, where OCI regions are embedded in AWS, Azure and GCP grew 1,529% in Q1. Cloud application revenue was $3.8 billion and up 10%, while our strategic back-office application revenue was $2.4 billion, up 16%. Total software revenue for the quarter was $5.7 billion, down 2%. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $14.9 billion, up 11% from last year and higher than the 8% growth reported in Q1 last year. Operating income grew 7% to $6.2 billion. We have also been on an accelerated journey to adopt AI internally to run more efficiently. I expect our operating income will grow mid-teens this year and higher still in FY '27. Non-GAAP EPS was USD 1.47 in U.S. dollars, while GAAP EPS was USD 1.01 in U.S. dollars. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20.5%, which was higher than the 19% guidance and caused EPS to be $0.03 lower. For the last 4 quarters, operating cash flow was up 13% to $21.5 billion, and free cash flow was a negative $5.9 billion with $27.4 billion of CapEx. Operating cash flow for Q1 was $8.1 billion, while free cash flow was a negative $362 million with CapEx of $8.5 billion. At quarter end, we had $11 billion in cash and marketable securities and short-term deferred revenue balance was $12 billion, up 5%. Over the last 10 years, we've reduced the shares outstanding by 1/3 at an average price of $55, which is, at this point, much less than 1/4 of our current stock price. This quarter, we repurchased 440,000 shares for a total of $95 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $5 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. Given our RPO growth, I now expect fiscal year '26 CapEx will be around $35 billion. As a reminder, the vast majority of our CapEx investments are for revenue-generating equipment that is going into the data centers and not for land or buildings. As we bring more capacity online, we will convert the large RPO backlog into accelerating revenue and profit growth. Now before I dive into specific Q2 guidance, I'd like to share some of the overarching thoughts on fiscal year '26 and the coming years. Clearly, it was an excellent quarter and demand for Oracle Cloud infrastructure continues to build. I expect we will sign additional multibillion-dollar customers and that RPO will likely grow to exceed $0.5 trillion. The enormity of this RPO growth enables us to make a large upward revision to the cloud infrastructure portion of our financial plan. We now expect Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will grow 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year and then increase to $32 billion, $73 billion, $114 billion and $144 billion over the following 4 years. Much of this revenue is already booked in our $455 billion RPO number, and we are off to a fantastic start this year. Now while much attention is focused on our GPU-related business, our non- GPU infrastructure business continues to grow much faster than our competitors. We are also seeing our industry-specific cloud applications drive customers to our back-office cloud apps. And finally, the Oracle database is booming with 34 multi-cloud data centers now live inside of Azure, GCP and AWS, and we will deliver another 37 data centers for a total of 71. All these trends point to revenue growth going higher. For fiscal year 2026, we remain confident and committed to full year total revenue growth of 16% in constant currency. Beyond fiscal year '26, I'm even more confident in our ability to further accelerate our top and bottom line growth rate. As mentioned, we will provide an update on our long-range financial targets at our Financial Analyst Meeting at Oracle AI World in Las Vegas in October. Now let me turn to my guidance for Q2, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis and assuming currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now. Currency should have a $0.03 positive impact on EPS and a 1% positive effect on revenue, depending on rounding. However, the actual currency impact may be different as it was in Q1. Here goes. Total revenue are expected to grow from 12% to 14% in constant currency and are expected to grow from 14% to 16% in U.S. dollars at today's exchange rate. Total cloud revenue is expected to grow from 32% to 36% in constant currency and is expected to grow from 33% to 37% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 8% to 10% and between -- be between $1.58 and $1.62 in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow 10% to 12% and be between USD $1.61 and USD 1.65. And lastly, my EPS guidance for Q2 assumes a base tax rate of 19%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary as they did this quarter. Larry, over to you."

      "text": "Co-Founder, Chairman & CTO Thank you, Safra. Eventually, AI will change everything. But right now, AI is fundamentally transforming Oracle and the rest of the computer industry, though not everyone fully grasp the extent of the tsunami that is approaching. Look at our quarterly numbers. Some things are undeniably evident. Several world-class AI companies have chosen Oracle to build large- scale GPU-centric data centers to train their AI models. That's because Oracle builds gigawatt scale data centers that are faster and more cost efficient at training AI models than anyone else in the world. Training AI models is a gigantic multitrillion-dollar market. It's hard to conceive of a technology market as large as that one. But if you look close, you can find one that's even larger. And it's the market for AI inferencing. Millions of customers using those AI models to run businesses and governments. In fact, the AI inferencing market will be much, much larger than the AI training market. AI inferencing will be used to run robotic factories, robotic cars, robotic greenhouses, biomolecular simulations for drug design, interpreting medical diagnostic images and laboratory results, automating laboratories, placing bets in financial markets, automating legal processes, automating financial processes, automating sales processes. AI is going to write that is generate the computer programs called AI agents. That will automate your sales and marketing processes. Let me repeat that. AI is going to automatically write the computer programs that will then automate your sales processes and your legal processes and everything else and in your factories and so on. Think about it. AI inferencing, it's AI inferencing that will change everything. Oracle is aggressively pursuing the AI. And we're not doing badly in the AI training market, by the way. With inferencing figure, oracle is aggressively pursuing the inferencing market as well as the AI training market. We think we are in a pretty good position to be a winner in the inferencing market because Oracle is by far the world's largest custodian of high-value private enterprise data. With the introduction of our new AI database, we added a very important new way for you to store your data in our database. You can vectorize it. And by vectorizing it, by vectorizing all your data, all your data can be understood by AI models. Then we made it very easy for our customers to directly connect all their databases, all their new Oracle AI databases and cloud storage, OCI Cloud storage to the world's most advanced AI reasoning models, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Llama, all of which are uniquely available in the Oracle Cloud. After you vectorize your data and link it to an LLM, the LLM of your choice, you can then ask any question you can think of. For example, how will the latest tariffs impact next quarter's revenue and profit? You asked that question, the large language model will then apply advanced reasoning to the combination of your private enterprise data plus publicly available data. you get answers to important questions without ever compromising the safety and security of your private data. Again, I'd like you to think about this for a moment. A lot of companies are saying, we're big into AI because we're writing agents. Well, guess what, we're writing a bunch of agents, too. But when they introduced ChatGPT almost 3 years ago, what you got to do is have a conversation and ask questions. You didn't -- you weren't automating some process with an agent. You could ask whatever question you wanted to ask and get a well-reasoned answer with all of the latest and best information and high-quality reason go along with it. Who's offering that to customers? We'll be the first when we deliver it and demonstrate it at AI World next month. That's what our customers have been asking for ever since the introduction of ChatGPT 3.5 almost 3 years ago. I want to ask questions about anything. And therefore, you need to understand my enterprise data as well as all the publicly available data. Then you can answer the questions that are most important to me. Well, now they can ask those questions. Back to you, Safra. Question and Answer"

So Larry and Safra, Oracle has become the de facto standard for AI training workloads and you make money at it and I have a lot of faith in that. But clearly, there's more here than just AI training. I know it's a big part of it. You talked about it. But can you talk about what else -- a little more detail about what else is driving these pretty amazing forecasts?"

      "role": "Co-Founder, Chairman & CTO",
      "text": "Co-Founder, Chairman & CTO Yes. Well, it's -- a lot of people are looking for inferencing capacity. I mean people are running out of inferencing capacity. I mean the company that called us -- I mentioned it, I think either last quarter or the quarter before, someone called us, we'll take all the capacity you have that's currently not being used anywhere in the world. We don't care. And I've never gotten a call like that. That's a very unusual call. That was for inferencing, not training. There is a huge amount of demand for inferencing. And if you think about it, in the end, all this money we're spending on training is going to have to be translated into products that are sold, which is all inferencing. And the inferencing market, again, is much larger than the training market. And yes, we are building -- like everybody else, we're building agents with our applications. But we're doing much more than that. No one's shown me a ChatGPT 3.5, again, 3 years ago, 3.5 -- 3 years ago, a little less than 3 years ago, when the ChatGPT amazed the world, and you could simply talk to your computer and ask questions and get well reasoned well questions based on the latest and most precise information as long as you ask those questions about publicly available data, and there's a lot of publicly available data. But if you combine the publicly available data with the enterprise data, which companies really don't want to share, you have to do it in such a way that your private enterprise data stays private, yet the large language model can still use it for reasoning so as to answer your question, like how do the latest tariffs or the latest steel prices or whatever affect my quarterly results? Affect my ability to deliver products, affect my revenue, affect my cost, answer those kinds of questions. To answer those kind of questions, we have to -- and we have. We had to change our database, fundamentally change our database so you can vectorize all data. That's the form in which large language models understand information after it's been vectorized. And then allowing people to ask any question they want about anything. And we -- that's exactly what we've done. But unless you have a database that is secure and reliable and linked to all of the popular LLMs, and we've done all of that, unless you have that and you have to tell me who else has that besides Oracle. Unless you have that, it's going to be very hard for you to deliver a ChatGPT-like experience on top of your data as well as publicly available data. That's a unique value proposition for Oracle. And that's because, again, we're the custodian of all of much more data than any of the application companies. They have their application data. They measure their customers in tens of thousands. We measure our customers in millions of databases. So we think we're better positioned than anybody to take advantage of inferencing."

Again, they want to put some things in our public cloud or in our competitors' public cloud working with the Oracle database. But simultaneously, there are a lot of reasons why they want what's called either a dedicated region or cloud a customer. We give our customers so much choice that there's very unusual for us not to be able to meet a customer's needs in one way or another. And then, of course, we have every piece of the stack. We have the infrastructure. We have the database that you're going to hear a lot about as really the only reasonable store for data that you want to use AI models against. And then we have all of these applications that are just taking off. So we just have a lot of different layers. They're all moving in the same direction, and they all benefit our customers when used together."

      "text": "Co-Founder, Chairman & CTO It's been a lot of work. And let me mention 2 other things, I think, that are actually shocking. We have gotten the entire Oracle Cloud, the whole thing, every feature, every function of the Oracle Cloud down to something we can put into a handful of racks, 3 racks, we call it Butterfly that cost $6 million. So we can give you a private version of the Oracle Cloud with every feature, every security feature, every function, everything we do for $6 million. I think the cost for the other hyperscalers is more than 100x that. So we can actually give our customers clouded customer, the full cloud customer. And we have companies like Vodafone. And I'm not sure which companies I can name and which companies I can't. We have large companies that are buying basically their own Oracle Cloud regions. In fact, multiple Oracle Cloud regions because they don't want to have any neighbors in their cloud. They don't want other companies in their cloud, but they want the full cloud. They want to pay as they consume, they want all the features, all the function, all the safety, the security. They don't want to have to buy it. They want us to buy and own the software and the hardware. They want us to maintain it, build the network to supply all of that, and they just want to pay for consumption. We can do that at an entry-level price that's 1% of what our competitors can offer. That's one thing. Another thing. Let me give you one more, and I'll stop there. We also have the most advanced application generator of any company. It's interesting. We're an application company and a cloud infrastructure company. And therefore, we build applications. And as we build applications, we'd like to be more efficient. And the way to be more efficient is to build AI application generators, and we have been doing that. And we -- the latest applications that we are building, we're not building them. They're being generated by AI. And we think we're far, far ahead of any of the other application companies in terms of generating the applications. So that's another very significant advantage we have. And of course -- and it's funny, I made the comment that we don't charge separately for our AI and our applications because our applications are AI. They're entirely AI. The new ones, the new ones that we're building, there are nothing other than a bunch of AI agents that we generate that are linked together with workflow. That's all they are. How do you charge separately for that? That's every application that we have. But the applications are better. And hopefully, we'll sell more, and that's the way we'll get paid for them. Thank you, John, for the very nice compliments."

And Oracle has a near 50-year track record of navigating transitions and coming out on top. But as we think about enterprise applications, investors are fairly pessimistic these days. And I'd love to hear your perspective, where do you see this all going for the industry? Where does the market share go to the companies that don't have the database that don't have the advantages that you have all the way down to the silicon? Is this maybe an extinction event?

      "role": "Co-Founder, Chairman & CTO",
      "text": "Co-Founder, Chairman & CTO Well, I think we have substantial advantages because we are an infrastructure company and we are an application company. There are 2 things that happen. As an application company, we needed -- we knew we had to start generating our applications. We just couldn't do it with armies of people anymore. We still need people, don't get me wrong. But the number of people we need is substantially less. And we can build/generate much better applications than we can hand build. And we've been working on these AI application generators for some time, and we're actually using them. But the thing is we're not just building application generators. We're building application generators and then we're building the applications, which gives us insights to make the application generator better. It's a huge advantage to be on both sides of that equation, both being an application builder and a builder of the application generation technology, the underlying AI application code generators. That's a huge advantage. Let me give you another advantage, which is often a disadvantage. We're very large. We no longer sell individual discrete applications. We sell suites of applications. We decided to go into the medical business against Epic, believing that we could solve much more of the problem because we're much bigger than they are. And by the way, we're much bigger than Workday and -- or ServiceNow. And we're solving a larger portion of the problem. We're able to -- we're able to do all of ERP, then we can add all of CRM, but all the pieces are engineered to fit together. That makes it so much easier for customers to consume. So we think that -- being good at application generation, the underlying technology makes us better -- build better applications, enables us to build more applications so we can solve more of the problem. So the customers don't have to do all that system integration across multiple vendors. We can just build a suite where all the pieces are engineered to fit together. I think we have tremendous advantages in the application space. We have tremendous advantages in the AI inferencing space where we can -- again, what we'll demonstrate at Oracle AI World next month is we've taken all of our customer data, all of it. I want to go into all the details now. But you can ask any question you want to ask. Who's your salesperson? Who's the #1 prospect in my territory? What products should I be selling them next? What are the reference -- what are the best references for me to use to persuade them to use our product. You can get all of those questions answered for you immediately if you're a salesperson. The engineers can look at which features of Oracle Financials are people making the most errors when they're using those features that I have to fix and make easier to use. You just ask the question because all of that data is available to AI models. We're the only -- is there anyone else doing this? Not that I know of."

So could you provide a bit more context on how much CapEx and operational cost structure will be needed to fully service these contracts? How we should think about the ramp of these costs relative to the ramp in revenue over the next few years? And generally, how investors should be thinking about the ROI on the spend?"

      "text": "CEO & Director Sure. So first of all, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, and as I've said very clearly beforehand, we do not own the property. We do not own the buildings. What we do own and what we engineer is the equipment. And that's equipment that is optimized for the Oracle Cloud. It has extremely special networking capabilities. It has technical capabilities from Larry and his team that allows us to run these workloads much, much faster. And as a result, it's much cheaper than our competitors. and depending on the workload. Now because of that, what we do is we put in that equipment only when it's time and usually very quickly, assuming that our customer accepts it, we're already generating revenue right away. The faster they accept the system and that it meets their needs, the faster they start using it, the sooner we have revenue. This is, in some ways, I don't want to call it asset-light from the finance world, but it's asset pretty light. And that is really an advantage for us. I know some of our competitors, they like to own buildings. That's not really our specialty. Our specialty is the unique technology, the unique networking, the storage, just the whole way we put these systems together. And by the way, they are identical and very simplified and again, making it possible for us to be very profitable while still being able to offer our customers an incredibly compelling price. What I have indicated is that CapEx looks like it's going to be about $35 billion for this fiscal year. But because we're monitoring this, we're literally putting it in right when we take possession and then handing it over to generate revenue right away. So we're very -- we have a very good line of sight for our capabilities to put this out and to -- and basically to just spend on that CapEx right before it starts generating revenue. But at this point, I'm looking at $35 billion for the year. And I think -- I mean, it could be a little higher, but I think -- and if it is higher, it's good news because it means more capacity has been handed over to me in terms of floor space. And as you also know, we are embedded in our competitors' cloud, again, all we are responsible for to pay for is, in fact, our equipment, and that goes right away. And there, we're moving ultimately to 71 data centers embedded in our competitors or flash partners."

      "text": "Co-Founder, Chairman & CTO Let me add a couple of very short things. One is we just turned over a giant data hall to one of our customers. And the acceptance time could have been as long as a couple of months. It was 1 week. It was 1 week from the time we owned -- officially owned the equipment, and they were testing it to the time they started paying for it, 1 week. So we have an extraordinary team that's doing an extraordinary job of making sure that we get the equipment working very quickly and our customers can accept it. They want to accept it as fast as possible because they want to do the work. They want to train their models. And this one took a huge haul, took 1 week for acceptance. It was extraordinary that -- the other, we are a very large consumer of networking equipment, GPUs, et cetera. Because we are a very large consumer, we are able, I think, to get better financing terms from the vendors than some of their people. So I think we have that going for us as well. I think we're going to do very well on the finance side. We have advantages there as well."

I'd like to focus on the AI training business you've been winning. Could you please explain to us how Oracle can create enough of a differentiated moat to assure this business does not get commoditized? And how do you continue to drive strong earnings and free cash flow from the training business even if training slows? I think people really need to understand that."

      "text": "Wolfe Research, LLC I really appreciate you squeezing me in. I originally was going to ask you if the new Oracle AI database really opens up the general enterprise inferencing market. And based on your script, it sounds like the answer to that question is hell yes. So I guess my follow-up question would be, how do you see that pacing happening over the course of the next few years? How soon after the introduction of the Oracle AI database, would you expect your enterprise customers, your sophisticated customers to really be open to interrogating their enterprise data in this fashion? And how does the current supply-constrained environment stand in the way of that demand? Or is it solving as we speak?"

      "text": "Co-Founder, Chairman & CTO Okay. I think who wouldn't want that? I mean I think everyone says they want to use AI. I mean every -- I mean, CEOs say they want to use AI. heads of state, heads of government say they want to use AI. We've never had consumers like that. I mean we -- historically, we don't deal with CEOs. Now we deal with CEOs. Now we deal with heads of government and heads of state on this because AI is so important. And letting people have -- use AI on top of their data, that is what they want to do. But they didn't know how to do it securely. They didn't know how to -- well, they didn't know how to do it, period. And one of the big risks was, oh my God, I can't share my -- JPMorgan Chase can't share all of its data. Goldman Sachs can't share all of its data with OpenAI, they won't do it. So -- or xAI or Lama or Meta, they won't -- it's got to keep it private. So we've got to keep your private data private. We've got to keep your private data secure. But we have to make it available for inferencing by the latest and best reasoning models from OpenAI and xAI and everyone else. And we've -- because we have the database, because we can vectorize all the data in the database, because we have very elaborate security models in our database, in the Oracle database. We can do all that. We can deliver all that. And then what we chose to do was to -- with the AI database was not only make sure we can vectorize all the data, so it can be understood by the AI model, we then bundled it with all of the AI models. That's why we did a deal with Google. That's why we did all of these deals where Gemini, you can get Gemini from the Oracle Cloud. You can get Brock from the Oracle Cloud. You can get ChatGPT from the Oracle Cloud. You get Lama from the Oracle Cloud, I can go on. So we bundled them together. So it's very easy for our customers to use these large language models on a combination. And that's what they want. It's a combination of all of the publicly available data and all of their enterprise data, which allows them to ask and get answered any question they can think of any question that's important to them. Everyone wants it. I think the demand is going to be insatiable. But we can deliver a lot of databases and a lot of AI across our cloud over the next several years. We're in a good position to do that."

Many of them will move in the public cloud using the Oracle AI database. But many and the largest enterprises will want their own either dedicated regions or Oracle Cloud customer. And again, they can finally get the benefit of AI for their own data using any LLM that they want because they're all in our cloud, too."
