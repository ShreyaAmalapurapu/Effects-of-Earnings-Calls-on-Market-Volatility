Thank you, Jonathan, and welcome to Micron Technologies' Fiscal Third\nQuarter 2025 Post-Earnings Analyst Call. On the call today with me today\nare Sumit Sadana, Micron's Chief Business Officer; Manish Bhatia, EVP of\nGlobal Operations; and Mark Murphy, our CFO.\n\n\nAs a reminder, the matters we're discussing today include forward-looking\nstatements regarding market demand and supply, market trends and drivers,\nand our expected results and guidance, and other matters. These forward-\nlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause\nactual results to differ materially from statements made today. We refer\nyou to documents we have filed with the SEC, including our most recent Form\n10-Q and upcoming 10-Q, for a discussion of risks that may affect our\nresults. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-\nlooking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results,\nlevels of activity, performance and achievements. We are under no duty to\nupdate any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to\nactual results.\nWe can now open the call up for Q&A.\n\n\nQuestion and Answer\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our first question for today comes from the line of Karl Ackerman from\nBNP Paribas.\n\n\nKarl  Ackerman\nBNP Paribas Exane, Research Division\n\nI have 2, please. This quarter, you raised your DRAM bit demand outlook for\ncalendar '25 to high teens from mid-teens. Is that only coming from your\noutlook on HBM? Or do you believe, excluding tariff pull-ins from certain\ncustomers that demand outlook for non-HBM DRAM has also improved? And I\nhave a follow-up, please.\n\n\nSumit Sadana\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nYes. Karl, this is Sumit here. This is a small change to our DRAM outlook\nfor calendar '25. We upgraded our view to the level you mentioned. Now\nthere is no impact of pull-ins in this assessment because whatever modest\namount of pull-in there might have been, for example, in CQ2 from CQ3 or\nFQ3 from FQ4, et cetera, that kind of pull-in activity is net neutral for\nthe full calendar year view. So the improvement is not impacted by any kind\nof pull-in activity.\n\n\nThe strength in our view of the AI business, i.e., the data center growth,\ncontinues to be pretty robust. And our view of the AI demand is certainly\nsupportive of the forecast that we have provided you for bit growth in\ncalendar '25. And the other positive thing that has happened over the last\n3 months is that we are seeing, after many, many quarters of a very\nchallenging environment in the broad distribution markets, industrial\nmarkets and some parts of the automotive market, we are now starting to see\nreally good improvements in demand in these broad distribution and\nindustrial markets. And that is also providing a tailwind to the overall\ncalendar '25 bit growth estimates.\n\n\nKarl  Ackerman\nBNP Paribas Exane, Research Division\n\nMark, given your expectations for another quarter of healthy free cash flow\nin the August quarter, I was hoping you could discuss how you might\nprioritize improving net leverage versus share buybacks, just given you\nelected to not repurchase stock in the quarter?\n\n\nMark J. Murphy\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nYes, Karl, as I mentioned in the earnings call, we're pleased with the\ndeleveraging that's happened. We're down now to a net debt of $3 billion,\nsubstantially down from the prior quarter. And I said on the call that we\nexpect to generate free cash flow in the fourth quarter. I would add that\nwe stand at record levels of cash and record levels of liquidity for the\ncompany. We're at $15.7 billion of liquidity, including our untapped\nfacility.\n\n\nSo we're in a great position to first continue to invest in the priorities\nof the business, maintaining our technology leadership, investing in needed\ncapacity in DRAM to serve HBM and other high-value, high-return markets and\nthen do return capital to shareholders through our routine dividend, which\nwe hope to grow over time, and then opportunistic repurchase. So I think\nthe balance sheet is in a great spot now, and we have a lot of flexibility.\nAnd on a covenant basis, I would add that we're actually basically at no\nleverage on a covenant basis.\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.\n\n\n\nAaron Christopher Rakers\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\n\nTwo, if I can as well. I think, Mark, first of all, I appreciate the gross\nmargin guidance. I think last quarter, we talked a little bit about start-\nup costs and the potential for underutilization flowing through inventory\non the NAND flash business. Obviously, demand dynamics have improved. I'm\njust curious, how should we think about those inputs to gross margin over\nthe next couple of quarters?\n\n\nAnd then I'll just ask my second question right out of the gate. The LPDDR\nbusiness in the data center side, we've talked for several quarters about\nyou being predominantly the sole provider of those solutions into some of\nthe AI silicon. I guess how do we think about that business as it\nprogresses to $1 billion plus of quarterly revenue? I think you've alluded\nto in the past as far as diversity of customer base there. Has that\nexpanded? Do you see a broadening market for that solution in data center?\n\n\nMark J. Murphy\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nYes, I'll start, Aaron. So as it relates to under-load utilization-related\nperiod costs, we brought those up, I think it was on the December call. And\nover the past 6 months, we sort of worked -- the last call, the March call,\nwe talked about how the structural capacity had come down and that we\nweren't incurring those period costs, they would end up being absorbed in\ninventories and pass-through. And that's what's happening. We have\nstructurally lowered capacity in NAND, and those costs all now just passed\nthrough on inventories.\n\n\nThe NAND volumes were very strong. So we're benefiting from some more\nloading there. But still, we're very careful about capacity in that market\nbecause that part of the business, the market environment is challenging.\nSo again, we talk about low CapEx levels, careful about node transition,\nwhere our bits are going and premium products in that market and watching\ninventories carefully. Inventories improved in NAND actually in the\nquarter, but they remain less healthy than DRAM, which DRAM, we actually\nexpect to be below target by the end of the year.\n\n\nAs it relates to the start-up costs that I mentioned last quarter, we do\nsee those beginning to increase, and very modestly now, but through '26,\nwe'll see some increase related to -- as you know, we're building Idaho 1,\nand we'll begin to see those beginning to increase in '26. We also see some\nFX-related costs. I mean, everybody knows that the dollar has been\nweakening, and so we're seeing a bit more of that. But since we made those\ncomments, the revenue outlook that we have is much higher. So those effects\nare 1 basis point less than what we talked about on the last call.\n\n\nNow I think that will have me reinforce, what's important is are we growing\nand we are positioning our bits in the right place. And we serve a market\nthat's growing, and we're getting leverage on those costs. And then our\nprice performance is critical. So we've done a great job of pricing in this\nmarket that's turning and becoming more constructive and which is why we\nhave a strong guide in the fourth quarter of 42%. And then we feel positive\nabout the trajectory of the business beyond that.\n\n\nSumit Sadana\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nAnd in terms of your question about LPDDR in the data center, we continue\nto be very excited about our sole source position in that market. It's\nbecome quite a large market and, of course, pioneered by one large company\nin the data center. Of course, as you know, the power consumption in the\ndata center continues to be an important driver of decisions and designs\nand architectural choices by our customers. And overall availability of\npower is an important driver of many decisions, including location of these\ndata centers.\n\n\nSo certainly, the interest in more broadly deploying LPDRAM in the data\ncenter amongst customers of scale continues to be high. And we do expect,\nbased on our interaction with customers as the pioneer of LPDRAM in the\ndata center in the world, we have multiple interactions going on with\ncustomers of different types and scale. And we do expect that LP will grow\nin its penetration in the data center over time. And we are very excited by\nour position and we'll be able to leverage that position as that growth\nunfolds.\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin from Stifel.\n\n\nBrian Edward Chin\nStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division\n\nI know you indicated on the call, in the slides, that DDR4 will be a low\nsingle-digit percent revenue exposure in fiscal second half of '25. But is\nthere a way to quantify how much of the 300 basis point sequential higher\ngross margin guide for fiscal 4Q maybe is attributed to DDR4 pricing?\nBecause I think that is a question that we're getting sort of post-call\nhere.\n\n\nMark J. Murphy\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nYes. I'll take that. The D4 pricing, that market has gotten tight as was\ntalked about in our prepared remarks. Customers are beginning to see\nincreasing shortages for D4. As you mentioned, it's a smaller part of our\nbusiness and, on a volume basis, getting smaller. The D4 pricing is a\npositive Q3 results and Q4 guide. But it's one of the many factors\ncontributing to the positive results, it's not a driver of that margin\nexpansion. So I would leave it at that.\n\n\nBrian Edward Chin\nStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division\n\nGot it. And that's sort of -- I know previously, you said 10% revenue could\nbe sort of DDR4 and now it's lower, maybe part of that is because of\nstrengthening in other, DDR5 and other areas, a mix. But I guess is this\npretty consistent with where your production is going as well as your\nfinished good inventory in terms of DDR4 being at sort of like a sub-10%\nkind of exposure?\n\n\nSumit Sadana\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nYes. Just to clarify, right, I mean our earlier comment about the 10% of\nrevenue was a combination of DDR4 and LPDDR4. And the comments that Mark\nmade and what we provided in the prepared remarks as well relate to DDR4\nonly, which is a low single-digit percent of our revenue. So LPDDR4 and\nDDR4 is together around 10% of revenue. DDR4 alone is low single-digit\npercent of revenue. And a lot of the things that you see on the spot market\nin terms of pricing relate to DDR4 only, and that part is a very small part\nof our overall business.\n\n\nBrian Edward Chin\nStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division\n\nGot it. Maybe just one quick follow-up. It sounds like mix, less consumer\norientation in terms of the bit shipments in fiscal 4Q. Is there any reason\nnot to -- I know you don't want to guide fiscal 1Q, November gross margins\nper se, but it would seem seasonal and kind of reasonableness that, that\nmix should only continue to get less consumer-oriented into fiscal 1Q. So\nany reason not to think that wouldn't be a bit of a tailwind on top of sort\nof shipping more 12-high HBM3E into the fiscal first quarter in terms of\ngross margins?\n\n\nMark J. Murphy\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nYes, Brian, we didn't guide -- we're not going to guide first quarter. But\nto your point, in the fourth quarter, we do see 2 forms of favorable mix at\na high level. One is just more DRAM growth relative to NAND, and so mixing\nmore DRAM, and then more data center relative to consumer. So you've got\nthose positive mix effects. And then to your point on what's the trajectory\ninto the November quarter, the market, we've talked about our inventories\nare very lean. We're a bit constrained as we look out to that quarter. So\nwe're focused on the best pricing decisions. And then we're continuing to\nwork for a favorable mix. So that's why on this call earlier, we said that\nwe can expand gross margins in November quarter, we believe.\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen.\n\n\nHadi M. Orabi\nTD Cowen, Research Division\n\nThis is Eddy for Krish. Congrats on the strong results. If we go back June\nof last year, you guys did give us some color about 2025 demand for HBM. I\nthink you mentioned like a multiple billion dollar opportunity, and you\ngave some color about the pricing, that pricing was being negotiated. But\nthis time, you guys chose not to. I wonder like are there any specific\nreasons? Like, are lead times different for HBM? Or is customer behavior\ndifferent or the competitive environment? Like, any color would be great.\nAnd on that note, I wonder like when you guys are expecting to hear from\nyour customer about 2026 demand. That's it for me.\n\n\nSumit Sadana\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nYes. So in terms of 2026 HBM, we do expect that HBM bit growth in '26 over\n2025 calendar year will be significantly faster than the overall DRAM bit\ngrowth. So HBM will continue to outrun the DRAM bit growth. Now when it\ncomes to the actual discussions with customers, compared to this time last\nyear, of course, we provided you a lot of details about 2025 expectations,\nand a lot of updates on color every quarter on what kind of milestones we\nwere reaching on HBM, and what kind of capacity ramp and yield improvements\nand percentage growth rates on quarters, and $1 billion quarter, 50% growth\nafter that in FQ3 from that $1 billion quarter in FQ2, et cetera, $1\nbillion-plus quarter in FQ2. So we have provided you a lot of these data\npoints over the last several quarters because we were still in the process\nof ramping our capacity and ramping our revenue and ramping our scale in\nHBM.\n\n\nOf course, HBM is now over a $6 billion run rate business for us based on\nthe last quarter's reported numbers. And so we are now at a place where we\ncan not only offer customers with our HBM products, world's best technology\nbased on our very mature capability in 1-beta node, but also the best power\nconsumption capabilities. So we have not only that, which we also had last\nyear, but we also now have the capacity in place and the scale in place to\nbe able to meet their growing demand. So we have earned the trust of our\ncustomers. We have terrific engagements with all of the major HBM consumers\nin the world, and we are deeply embedded in their road maps, not just for\nHBM4, which we had just sampled, but also for HBM4E, where we have\nmultiyear R&D engagements to do co-design work that relate to the custom-\nbased die that HBM4E will have. So we are very excited about the growth\nopportunity. We are very confident about our place in the competitive\nlandscape. We are very happy and glad to see the contributions of our team\non the execution front from ramping the high-quality output to getting the\nfinancial benefits of growing this business in our portfolio.\n\n\nIn terms of the discussions with the customers, our customers are going\nthrough a lot of rapid transitions. We're going from 8-high to 12-high that\nis in progress right now on HBM3. HBM4 has been sampled to them by us, and\nthey are considering the timing of their platform transitions that will\nleverage HBM4. And they're still -- most of our customers are still in the\nprocess of finalizing their plans for 2026 in terms of the transition time\nlines of their key platforms, which will then determine the mix of products\nthey have to purchase. And HBM products, as you know, come with very\ndifferent type of lead times than the rest of the business. We like to\nensure that when we start these wafers, we have very good visibility to the\ndemand and good agreement and understanding with our customers on what\nvolumes they will take in what time frame.\n\n\nAnd consequently, our customers have a higher bar in terms of providing\nthose forecasts to us, a higher bar of fidelity of quality of those\nforecasts. And so they have to go through the assessment of what their\nplatform transition timings will be, what their volumes by product will be.\nAnd that business, as it has scaled, has become much more complex due to\nits scale. And we are just going through those discussions with those\ncustomers. And as and when these agreements -- as and when we have the full\nvisibility to all of these numbers and the agreements will fall in place,\nthen we have confidence that we will end up with a terrific trajectory of\nour HBM business.\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor\nFitzgerald.\n\n\nChristopher James Muse\nCantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division\n\nI was hoping you could hit on, I guess, where you think you are seeing\ntariff-related pull-ins. And if you can kind of comment between both DRAM\nand NAND and kind of consumer and nonconsumer. And you did take up your\nDRAM bit outlook for the year. Can you also discuss what's driving the\nuptick there?\n\n\nSumit Sadana\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nYes. I think I had mentioned earlier in the call, I'll take your second\npart of the question first, I had mentioned in the earlier part of the call\nthat the improvement in the DRAM outlook for the calendar year 2025 has\nnothing to do with any kind of tariff-related movement that may have\noccurred for some customers. It has a lot to do with the fact that we\ncontinue to see robust demand driven by AI in the data center. This is not\njust HBM demand, but all data center-related DRAM demand. We are seeing\nimprovements from the CQ1 levels of data center SSD type of demand there as\nwell. But really, the other area of improvement beyond the data center in\nDRAM has come from our improved view of what's happening in the industrial\nand broad distribution markets. These markets have not grown much for many\nquarters, and you have seen that view across the semiconductor industry.\nBut now these markets seem to be improving their growth trajectory, firming\nup their growth forecast. So that's helping 2025 view of DRAM growth.\n\n\nNow as it relates to the tariffs and what some customers may have done,\nfirst, I just wanted to reiterate that whatever impact tariffs may have had\non customer order patterns, we think that overall impact is fairly modest\nin our FQ3 numbers. And we actually are not too concerned about what the\ntariff-related impact has been because the customer -- our customers'\naggregate demand signals for the remainder of calendar 2025 continue to be\nhealthy. And so we feel like we are in a constructive demand environment\nfor the next -- for the remaining part of calendar '25. And of course,\nthere is uncertainty related to tariffs and whatever may hence happen to\nthe macro environment, and we are mindful of that uncertainty, but we also\nknow that we are one of the most agile businesses out there in responding\nto any changes that may occur.\n\n\nSo with that said, the tariff-related movement from certain customers may\nhave mainly been to stage inventory of their own finished goods in\ndifferent parts in different geographies and that may have created some\nneed for memory products in terms of a pull-in effect. But again, the\noverall impact fairly modest.\n\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Vijay\nRakesh from Mizuho.\n\n\nVijay Raghavan Rakesh\nMizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division\n\nJust a quick follow-up. When you look at your HBM4, I think you guys\nmentioned the CMOS logic die. Can you talk to how that compares to -- I\nthink some of your peers have talked about FinFET as well and how that\ncould drive higher ASPs on your HBM4, I guess, versus HBM3E?\n\n\nSumit Sadana\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nYes. The HBM4 cost and price is expected to be higher than HBM3. We do\nexpect that -- the product itself has remarkably better specs, as you have\nseen from our press release as well on HBM4. So in terms of value that it\ncreates at the system level is also very robust value for our customers.\nBut we do expect that the pricing on HBM4 on a per bit basis will be higher\nthan that of HBM3E. And so we definitely will look forward to the tailwind\nfrom that growth as well.\n\n\nManish H. Bhatia\nExecutive Vice President of Global Operations\n\nVijay, I think Sanjay made this point -- this is Manish. I think Sanjay\nmade this point on the call, and maybe this is -- everyone knows this, but\nthe JEDEC standard die size for HBM4 is larger than it is for HBM3E for all\nplayers. So that's why the trade ratio, the cost with HBM4 will be higher.\nAnd just to reiterate, we're building our HBM4 on our now 2-years-old 1-\nbeta technology, very, very proven, very strong performing product and\nwhere, similarly, our logic die is going to be built internally. So the\nintegration between the memory and the logic is also proven from our HBM3E\nprocesses. In the advanced packaging process, we're leveraging all the\nlearnings. So we feel very good about the road map decisions that we've\nmade relative to HBM4 in order to intersect the market as soon as our\ncustomers are ready with a terrific performing product as well.\n\n\nSatya  Kumar\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer\n\nGot it. And just one quick last one. On the pull-in, I'm sorry to beat a\ndead horse, I know you said still seeing second half strong data center,\nbut is there any pull-in from Q1 into 4Q? Or is that -- should we be\nconcerned about that? And can you frame that a little bit?\n\n\nSumit Sadana\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nYes. We think that any kind of pull-in activity, in aggregate, whether it\nis Q3, FQ3, FQ4, is modest amount of impact. And we continue to feel that\nthe overall demand environment beyond the FQ4 time horizon, which is the\nrest of the calendar year beyond FQ4, remains in a healthy place in terms\nof our customer signals. This is part of the reason why we also feel good\nabout driving the pricing of our products. Our inventories are in a good\nplace. We expect the pricing to improve in FQ4. And again, we don't see\nthat as just a very much tariff-related or pull-in related effect. It's\nmore of an overall market environment impact. And that's why we have also\nprovided you a view of DRAM bit growth in calendar '25, which is now\nimproved versus what we mentioned to you just a quarter ago.\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS.\n\n\nTimothy Michael Arcuri\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\n\nI'm trying to figure out just the pricing modeling on HBM. So nearly half\nof the dollar revenue growth in DRAM came from HBM, where we know that the\nprice is many multiples of the non-HBM. I don't know, most would say it's\nprobably 4.5 to like 5x. So I get that the HBM ASP -- or sorry, that the\nnon-HBM ASP would have come down because of the mix to consumer. But why\nwould the HBM ASP have come down? Because it had to come down a lot for\noverall DRAM pricing to be down. If half of the dollar growth came from\nHBM, pricing had to be down in HBM. So why would that have been the case?\nIs this like product transition related? And I guess I'm just asking, like,\nis the pricing noisy on a sequential basis? Yes.\n\n\nSumit Sadana\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nYes. I mean the HBM pricing is not noisy, and it's not going up and down in\nthe way you're describing. I think if you look at our results, and\nparticularly, I'll point you to the growth in our mobile business, which\nhas been very significant, the price points in mobile tend to be quite low\ncompared to data center. And so definitely, when you look at the overall\nmix -- and the mobile business is a pretty sizable business. It's not a\ntrivial business. It's a large part of the TAM as well. And so when you\nlook at the overall effect, on a like-for-like basis, we have improved\npricing, we have growth in HBM happening, but we also have fairly\nsignificant increase in consumer-oriented mix in FQ3.\n\n\nWe had highlighted -- when we provided guidance for FQ3 last quarter, we\nhighlighted to you that we would be having a significant increase in our\nconsumer mix. And that has been driven by the fact that it took several\nquarters for the inventories in client and smartphones to get to healthy\nlevels after being heavy in inventory in the second half of calendar 2024.\nAnd we were shipping into these markets on the consumer side at a very low\nrate compared to the ship out rate from these markets because of that\ninventory level. So when that inventory level became normalized, our growth\nrate in FQ3 has suddenly jumped in a lot of these consumer end markets,\nwhich carry lower price points. So even though we have had very steady\npricing on the HBM front and like-for-like pricing increases, the mix\nchange has been so sharp that it has caused the impacts on the high-level\npricing that we were observing in the numbers.\n\n\nTimothy Michael Arcuri\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\n\nRight. So the message is that HBM price was still up. It's that the non-HBM\nprice was down such that the blended ASP was down low single digits. That's\nthe message, correct?\n\n\nSumit Sadana\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nYes. I mean the message is that the HBM pricing is steady, and the pricing\nwe have on the DRAM side like-for-like has improved sequentially. And it's\nreally the mix change on the consumer side that has done this. Now we spoke\nabout this on the DRAM side. But of course, on the NAND side, we have some\ndifferent dynamics, including the fact that the market environment is not\nas healthy as it is on the DRAM side, it's a more challenging environment\non the NAND side. And so the NAND dynamics are different. But I just wanted\nto make sure that I clarify that the DRAM dynamics are very healthy.\n\n\nTimothy Michael Arcuri\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\n\nTotally. Totally great. And then just one last quick one, just on the cost.\nSo costs had to be down a lot in both DRAM and NAND, had to be down like\nmid-single digits in both, definitely better than what I would have\nthought. Why was that? I know, Mark, you talked about these NAND headwinds,\nbut it seems like they weren't anywhere near as bad as what you thought\nthey'd be. So how do the costs work so that they were down so much?\n\n\nManish H. Bhatia\nExecutive Vice President of Global Operations\n\nMark? And then I'll add some color.\n\n\nMark J. Murphy\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nYes. I would just say, Tim, that I mean, mix affects costs, as you know.\nAnd so there's some of those effects. I think just on costs overall, front-\nend bit cost reductions, HBM and DRAM and for NAND, they're generally on\ntrack with the front-end cost reduction ranges that we've talked about\nbefore. So I think if you're looking to model things going forward, I think\nthat's something to keep in mind.\n\n\nOur business is changing to this mix issue. Our business is changing with\nour focus on the higher performance part of the market. Sometimes that has\nsome higher costs associated with it, but it's higher margin. And so we get\nhigher value out of that. And again, the mix is really affecting the cost.\nSo you'll see us move away from -- traditionally, what we would do is drill\ninto the cost detail every call because it's becoming a harder metric to\nfollow with the improving mix that we are driving in the business.\n\n\nManish H. Bhatia\nExecutive Vice President of Global Operations\n\nAnd Tim, I'll just add a little. I mean, I mentioned on the call that our\nHBM 12-high yields are doing better than our initial HBM 8-high ramp was a\nyear ago at this time and better than our expectations. So overall HBM came\nin a little better than our expectations last quarter. And there were\ncertain other areas that Mark and Sanjay both commented on a little bit\nthat our cost performance was operationally better. But as Mark mentioned,\na lot of it is due to mix.\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our final question today comes from the line of Chris Danely from Citi.\n\n\n\nUnknown Analyst\n\nThis is James filling in for Chris. I just had one question. I think it was\nprobably about a conference a couple of months ago, but you said the August\nquarter gross margins could be flattish to slightly up compared to this\nquarter. Was there any major change in that other than some pricing and you\ntalked about the data center mix? But just wanted to dig on that.\n\n\nMark J. Murphy\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nYes. I think I covered this on the main call that when we provide that\nguidance, it was in a period of transition. We did know that inventory\noutlook was improving. And we indicated on that call that we intended to\nwork to inflect price. The conditions of the market are just better than we\nexpected when we gave that guidance. And our performance, particularly on\nprice relative to what we thought the market would bear was better. And\nthen that's carrying into the fourth quarter. So you reset the baseline, we\ndid 39% versus our guide of 36.5%. And so from that baseline of 39%, we're\nseeing still a constructive market environment, particularly in DRAM or\nespecially in DRAM. And then we're -- so we're still focused on price. But\nthe 39% to 42% guide, the majority of that is driven by favorable mix\neffects. So more DRAM growth relative NAND and, if we cut by markets, more\ndata center than consumer-oriented mix.\n\n\nOperatorThis does conclude the question-and-answer session as well as\ntoday's program.

Thank you, Jonathan, and welcome to Micron Technologies' Fiscal Third\nQuarter 2025 Post-Earnings Analyst Call. On the call today with me today\nare Sumit Sadana, Micron's Chief Business Officer; Manish Bhatia, EVP of\nGlobal Operations; and Mark Murphy, our CFO.\n\n\nAs a reminder, the matters we're discussing today include forward-looking\nstatements regarding market demand and supply, market trends and drivers,\nand our expected results and guidance, and other matters.

  "qa_text": "Operator\n\nAnd our first question for today comes from the line of Karl Ackerman from\nBNP Paribas.\n\n\nKarl  Ackerman\nBNP Paribas Exane, Research Division\n\nI have 2, please. This quarter, you raised your DRAM bit demand outlook for\ncalendar '25 to high teens from mid-teens. Is that only coming from your\noutlook on HBM? Or do you believe, excluding tariff pull-ins from certain\ncustomers that demand outlook for non-HBM DRAM has also improved? And I\nhave a follow-up, please.\n\n\nSumit Sadana\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nYes. Karl, this is Sumit here. This is a small change to our DRAM outlook\nfor calendar '25. We upgraded our view to the level you mentioned. Now\nthere is no impact of pull-ins in this assessment because whatever modest\namount of pull-in there might have been, for example, in CQ2 from CQ3 or\nFQ3 from FQ4, et cetera, that kind of pull-in activity is net neutral for\nthe full calendar year view. So the improvement is not impacted by any kind\nof pull-in activity.\n\n\nThe strength in our view of the AI business, i.e., the data center growth,\ncontinues to be pretty robust. And our view of the AI demand is certainly\nsupportive of the forecast that we have provided you for bit growth in\ncalendar '25. And the other positive thing that has happened over the last\n3 months is that we are seeing, after many, many quarters of a very\nchallenging environment in the broad distribution markets, industrial\nmarkets and some parts of the automotive market, we are now starting to see\nreally good improvements in demand in these broad distribution and\nindustrial markets. And that is also providing a tailwind to the overall\ncalendar '25 bit growth estimates.\n\n\nKarl  Ackerman\nBNP Paribas Exane, Research Division\n\nMark, given your expectations for another quarter of healthy free cash flow\nin the August quarter, I was hoping you could discuss how you might\nprioritize improving net leverage versus share buybacks, just given you\nelected to not repurchase stock in the quarter?\n\n\nMark J. Murphy\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nYes, Karl, as I mentioned in the earnings call, we're pleased with the\ndeleveraging that's happened. We're down now to a net debt of $3 billion,\nsubstantially down from the prior quarter. And I said on the call that we\nexpect to generate free cash flow in the fourth quarter. I would add that\nwe stand at record levels of cash and record levels of liquidity for the\ncompany. We're at $15.7 billion of liquidity, including our untapped\nfacility.\n\n\nSo we're in a great position to first continue to invest in the priorities\nof the business, maintaining our technology leadership, investing in needed\ncapacity in DRAM to serve HBM and other high-value, high-return markets and\nthen do return capital to shareholders through our routine dividend, which\nwe hope to grow over time, and then opportunistic repurchase. So I think\nthe balance sheet is in a great spot now, and we have a lot of flexibility.\nAnd on a covenant basis, I would add that we're actually basically at no\nleverage on a covenant basis.\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.\n\n\n\nAaron Christopher Rakers\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\n\nTwo, if I can as well. I think, Mark, first of all, I appreciate the gross\nmargin guidance. I think last quarter, we talked a little bit about start-\nup costs and the potential for underutilization flowing through inventory\non the NAND flash business. Obviously, demand dynamics have improved. I'm\njust curious, how should we think about those inputs to gross margin over\nthe next couple of quarters?\n\n\nAnd then I'll just ask my second question right out of the gate. The LPDDR\nbusiness in the data center side, we've talked for several quarters about\nyou being predominantly the sole provider of those solutions into some of\nthe AI silicon. I guess how do we think about that business as it\nprogresses to $1 billion plus of quarterly revenue? I think you've alluded\nto in the past as far as diversity of customer base there. Has that\nexpanded? Do you see a broadening market for that solution in data center?\n\n\nMark J. Murphy\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nYes, I'll start, Aaron. So as it relates to under-load utilization-related\nperiod costs, we brought those up, I think it was on the December call. And\nover the past 6 months, we sort of worked -- the last call, the March call,\nwe talked about how the structural capacity had come down and that we\nweren't incurring those period costs, they would end up being absorbed in\ninventories and pass-through. And that's what's happening. We have\nstructurally lowered capacity in NAND, and those costs all now just passed\nthrough on inventories.\n\n\nThe NAND volumes were very strong. So we're benefiting from some more\nloading there. But still, we're very careful about capacity in that market\nbecause that part of the business, the market environment is challenging.\nSo again, we talk about low CapEx levels, careful about node transition,\nwhere our bits are going and premium products in that market and watching\ninventories carefully. Inventories improved in NAND actually in the\nquarter, but they remain less healthy than DRAM, which DRAM, we actually\nexpect to be below target by the end of the year.\n\n\nAs it relates to the start-up costs that I mentioned last quarter, we do\nsee those beginning to increase, and very modestly now, but through '26,\nwe'll see some increase related to -- as you know, we're building Idaho 1,\nand we'll begin to see those beginning to increase in '26. We also see some\nFX-related costs. I mean, everybody knows that the dollar has been\nweakening, and so we're seeing a bit more of that. But since we made those\ncomments, the revenue outlook that we have is much higher. So those effects\nare 1 basis point less than what we talked about on the last call.\n\n\nNow I think that will have me reinforce, what's important is are we growing\nand we are positioning our bits in the right place. And we serve a market\nthat's growing, and we're getting leverage on those costs. And then our\nprice performance is critical. So we've done a great job of pricing in this\nmarket that's turning and becoming more constructive and which is why we\nhave a strong guide in the fourth quarter of 42%. And then we feel positive\nabout the trajectory of the business beyond that.\n\n\nSumit Sadana\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nAnd in terms of your question about LPDDR in the data center, we continue\nto be very excited about our sole source position in that market. It's\nbecome quite a large market and, of course, pioneered by one large company\nin the data center. Of course, as you know, the power consumption in the\ndata center continues to be an important driver of decisions and designs\nand architectural choices by our customers. And overall availability of\npower is an important driver of many decisions, including location of these\ndata centers.\n\n\nSo certainly, the interest in more broadly deploying LPDRAM in the data\ncenter amongst customers of scale continues to be high. And we do expect,\nbased on our interaction with customers as the pioneer of LPDRAM in the\ndata center in the world, we have multiple interactions going on with\ncustomers of different types and scale. And we do expect that LP will grow\nin its penetration in the data center over time. And we are very excited by\nour position and we'll be able to leverage that position as that growth\nunfolds.\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin from Stifel.\n\n\nBrian Edward Chin\nStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division\n\nI know you indicated on the call, in the slides, that DDR4 will be a low\nsingle-digit percent revenue exposure in fiscal second half of '25. But is\nthere a way to quantify how much of the 300 basis point sequential higher\ngross margin guide for fiscal 4Q maybe is attributed to DDR4 pricing?\nBecause I think that is a question that we're getting sort of post-call\nhere.\n\n\nMark J. Murphy\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nYes. I'll take that. The D4 pricing, that market has gotten tight as was\ntalked about in our prepared remarks. Customers are beginning to see\nincreasing shortages for D4. As you mentioned, it's a smaller part of our\nbusiness and, on a volume basis, getting smaller. The D4 pricing is a\npositive Q3 results and Q4 guide. But it's one of the many factors\ncontributing to the positive results, it's not a driver of that margin\nexpansion. So I would leave it at that.\n\n\nBrian Edward Chin\nStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division\n\nGot it. And that's sort of -- I know previously, you said 10% revenue could\nbe sort of DDR4 and now it's lower, maybe part of that is because of\nstrengthening in other, DDR5 and other areas, a mix. But I guess is this\npretty consistent with where your production is going as well as your\nfinished good inventory in terms of DDR4 being at sort of like a sub-10%\nkind of exposure?\n\n\nSumit Sadana\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nYes. Just to clarify, right, I mean our earlier comment about the 10% of\nrevenue was a combination of DDR4 and LPDDR4. And the comments that Mark\nmade and what we provided in the prepared remarks as well relate to DDR4\nonly, which is a low single-digit percent of our revenue. So LPDDR4 and\nDDR4 is together around 10% of revenue. DDR4 alone is low single-digit\npercent of revenue. And a lot of the things that you see on the spot market\nin terms of pricing relate to DDR4 only, and that part is a very small part\nof our overall business.\n\n\nBrian Edward Chin\nStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division\n\nGot it. Maybe just one quick follow-up. It sounds like mix, less consumer\norientation in terms of the bit shipments in fiscal 4Q. Is there any reason\nnot to -- I know you don't want to guide fiscal 1Q, November gross margins\nper se, but it would seem seasonal and kind of reasonableness that, that\nmix should only continue to get less consumer-oriented into fiscal 1Q. So\nany reason not to think that wouldn't be a bit of a tailwind on top of sort\nof shipping more 12-high HBM3E into the fiscal first quarter in terms of\ngross margins?\n\n\nMark J. Murphy\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nYes, Brian, we didn't guide -- we're not going to guide first quarter. But\nto your point, in the fourth quarter, we do see 2 forms of favorable mix at\na high level. One is just more DRAM growth relative to NAND, and so mixing\nmore DRAM, and then more data center relative to consumer. So you've got\nthose positive mix effects. And then to your point on what's the trajectory\ninto the November quarter, the market, we've talked about our inventories\nare very lean. We're a bit constrained as we look out to that quarter. So\nwe're focused on the best pricing decisions. And then we're continuing to\nwork for a favorable mix. So that's why on this call earlier, we said that\nwe can expand gross margins in November quarter, we believe.\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen.\n\n\nHadi M. Orabi\nTD Cowen, Research Division\n\nThis is Eddy for Krish. Congrats on the strong results. If we go back June\nof last year, you guys did give us some color about 2025 demand for HBM. I\nthink you mentioned like a multiple billion dollar opportunity, and you\ngave some color about the pricing, that pricing was being negotiated. But\nthis time, you guys chose not to. I wonder like are there any specific\nreasons? Like, are lead times different for HBM? Or is customer behavior\ndifferent or the competitive environment? Like, any color would be great.\nAnd on that note, I wonder like when you guys are expecting to hear from\nyour customer about 2026 demand. That's it for me.\n\n\nSumit Sadana\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nYes. So in terms of 2026 HBM, we do expect that HBM bit growth in '26 over\n2025 calendar year will be significantly faster than the overall DRAM bit\ngrowth. So HBM will continue to outrun the DRAM bit growth. Now when it\ncomes to the actual discussions with customers, compared to this time last\nyear, of course, we provided you a lot of details about 2025 expectations,\nand a lot of updates on color every quarter on what kind of milestones we\nwere reaching on HBM, and what kind of capacity ramp and yield improvements\nand percentage growth rates on quarters, and $1 billion quarter, 50% growth\nafter that in FQ3 from that $1 billion quarter in FQ2, et cetera, $1\nbillion-plus quarter in FQ2. So we have provided you a lot of these data\npoints over the last several quarters because we were still in the process\nof ramping our capacity and ramping our revenue and ramping our scale in\nHBM.\n\n\nOf course, HBM is now over a $6 billion run rate business for us based on\nthe last quarter's reported numbers. And so we are now at a place where we\ncan not only offer customers with our HBM products, world's best technology\nbased on our very mature capability in 1-beta node, but also the best power\nconsumption capabilities. So we have not only that, which we also had last\nyear, but we also now have the capacity in place and the scale in place to\nbe able to meet their growing demand. So we have earned the trust of our\ncustomers. We have terrific engagements with all of the major HBM consumers\nin the world, and we are deeply embedded in their road maps, not just for\nHBM4, which we had just sampled, but also for HBM4E, where we have\nmultiyear R&D engagements to do co-design work that relate to the custom-\nbased die that HBM4E will have. So we are very excited about the growth\nopportunity. We are very confident about our place in the competitive\nlandscape. We are very happy and glad to see the contributions of our team\non the execution front from ramping the high-quality output to getting the\nfinancial benefits of growing this business in our portfolio.\n\n\nIn terms of the discussions with the customers, our customers are going\nthrough a lot of rapid transitions. We're going from 8-high to 12-high that\nis in progress right now on HBM3. HBM4 has been sampled to them by us, and\nthey are considering the timing of their platform transitions that will\nleverage HBM4. And they're still -- most of our customers are still in the\nprocess of finalizing their plans for 2026 in terms of the transition time\nlines of their key platforms, which will then determine the mix of products\nthey have to purchase. And HBM products, as you know, come with very\ndifferent type of lead times than the rest of the business. We like to\nensure that when we start these wafers, we have very good visibility to the\ndemand and good agreement and understanding with our customers on what\nvolumes they will take in what time frame.\n\n\nAnd consequently, our customers have a higher bar in terms of providing\nthose forecasts to us, a higher bar of fidelity of quality of those\nforecasts. And so they have to go through the assessment of what their\nplatform transition timings will be, what their volumes by product will be.\nAnd that business, as it has scaled, has become much more complex due to\nits scale. And we are just going through those discussions with those\ncustomers. And as and when these agreements -- as and when we have the full\nvisibility to all of these numbers and the agreements will fall in place,\nthen we have confidence that we will end up with a terrific trajectory of\nour HBM business.\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor\nFitzgerald.\n\n\nChristopher James Muse\nCantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division\n\nI was hoping you could hit on, I guess, where you think you are seeing\ntariff-related pull-ins. And if you can kind of comment between both DRAM\nand NAND and kind of consumer and nonconsumer. And you did take up your\nDRAM bit outlook for the year. Can you also discuss what's driving the\nuptick there?\n\n\nSumit Sadana\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nYes. I think I had mentioned earlier in the call, I'll take your second\npart of the question first, I had mentioned in the earlier part of the call\nthat the improvement in the DRAM outlook for the calendar year 2025 has\nnothing to do with any kind of tariff-related movement that may have\noccurred for some customers. It has a lot to do with the fact that we\ncontinue to see robust demand driven by AI in the data center. This is not\njust HBM demand, but all data center-related DRAM demand. We are seeing\nimprovements from the CQ1 levels of data center SSD type of demand there as\nwell. But really, the other area of improvement beyond the data center in\nDRAM has come from our improved view of what's happening in the industrial\nand broad distribution markets. These markets have not grown much for many\nquarters, and you have seen that view across the semiconductor industry.\nBut now these markets seem to be improving their growth trajectory, firming\nup their growth forecast. So that's helping 2025 view of DRAM growth.\n\n\nNow as it relates to the tariffs and what some customers may have done,\nfirst, I just wanted to reiterate that whatever impact tariffs may have had\non customer order patterns, we think that overall impact is fairly modest\nin our FQ3 numbers. And we actually are not too concerned about what the\ntariff-related impact has been because the customer -- our customers'\naggregate demand signals for the remainder of calendar 2025 continue to be\nhealthy. And so we feel like we are in a constructive demand environment\nfor the next -- for the remaining part of calendar '25. And of course,\nthere is uncertainty related to tariffs and whatever may hence happen to\nthe macro environment, and we are mindful of that uncertainty, but we also\nknow that we are one of the most agile businesses out there in responding\nto any changes that may occur.\n\n\nSo with that said, the tariff-related movement from certain customers may\nhave mainly been to stage inventory of their own finished goods in\ndifferent parts in different geographies and that may have created some\nneed for memory products in terms of a pull-in effect. But again, the\noverall impact fairly modest.\n\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Vijay\nRakesh from Mizuho.\n\n\nVijay Raghavan Rakesh\nMizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division\n\nJust a quick follow-up. When you look at your HBM4, I think you guys\nmentioned the CMOS logic die. Can you talk to how that compares to -- I\nthink some of your peers have talked about FinFET as well and how that\ncould drive higher ASPs on your HBM4, I guess, versus HBM3E?\n\n\nSumit Sadana\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nYes. The HBM4 cost and price is expected to be higher than HBM3. We do\nexpect that -- the product itself has remarkably better specs, as you have\nseen from our press release as well on HBM4. So in terms of value that it\ncreates at the system level is also very robust value for our customers.\nBut we do expect that the pricing on HBM4 on a per bit basis will be higher\nthan that of HBM3E. And so we definitely will look forward to the tailwind\nfrom that growth as well.\n\n\nManish H. Bhatia\nExecutive Vice President of Global Operations\n\nVijay, I think Sanjay made this point -- this is Manish. I think Sanjay\nmade this point on the call, and maybe this is -- everyone knows this, but\nthe JEDEC standard die size for HBM4 is larger than it is for HBM3E for all\nplayers. So that's why the trade ratio, the cost with HBM4 will be higher.\nAnd just to reiterate, we're building our HBM4 on our now 2-years-old 1-\nbeta technology, very, very proven, very strong performing product and\nwhere, similarly, our logic die is going to be built internally. So the\nintegration between the memory and the logic is also proven from our HBM3E\nprocesses. In the advanced packaging process, we're leveraging all the\nlearnings. So we feel very good about the road map decisions that we've\nmade relative to HBM4 in order to intersect the market as soon as our\ncustomers are ready with a terrific performing product as well.\n\n\nSatya  Kumar\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer\n\nGot it. And just one quick last one. On the pull-in, I'm sorry to beat a\ndead horse, I know you said still seeing second half strong data center,\nbut is there any pull-in from Q1 into 4Q? Or is that -- should we be\nconcerned about that? And can you frame that a little bit?\n\n\nSumit Sadana\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nYes. We think that any kind of pull-in activity, in aggregate, whether it\nis Q3, FQ3, FQ4, is modest amount of impact. And we continue to feel that\nthe overall demand environment beyond the FQ4 time horizon, which is the\nrest of the calendar year beyond FQ4, remains in a healthy place in terms\nof our customer signals. This is part of the reason why we also feel good\nabout driving the pricing of our products. Our inventories are in a good\nplace. We expect the pricing to improve in FQ4. And again, we don't see\nthat as just a very much tariff-related or pull-in related effect. It's\nmore of an overall market environment impact. And that's why we have also\nprovided you a view of DRAM bit growth in calendar '25, which is now\nimproved versus what we mentioned to you just a quarter ago.\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS.\n\n\nTimothy Michael Arcuri\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\n\nI'm trying to figure out just the pricing modeling on HBM. So nearly half\nof the dollar revenue growth in DRAM came from HBM, where we know that the\nprice is many multiples of the non-HBM. I don't know, most would say it's\nprobably 4.5 to like 5x. So I get that the HBM ASP -- or sorry, that the\nnon-HBM ASP would have come down because of the mix to consumer. But why\nwould the HBM ASP have come down? Because it had to come down a lot for\noverall DRAM pricing to be down. If half of the dollar growth came from\nHBM, pricing had to be down in HBM. So why would that have been the case?\nIs this like product transition related? And I guess I'm just asking, like,\nis the pricing noisy on a sequential basis? Yes.\n\n\nSumit Sadana\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nYes. I mean the HBM pricing is not noisy, and it's not going up and down in\nthe way you're describing. I think if you look at our results, and\nparticularly, I'll point you to the growth in our mobile business, which\nhas been very significant, the price points in mobile tend to be quite low\ncompared to data center. And so definitely, when you look at the overall\nmix -- and the mobile business is a pretty sizable business. It's not a\ntrivial business. It's a large part of the TAM as well. And so when you\nlook at the overall effect, on a like-for-like basis, we have improved\npricing, we have growth in HBM happening, but we also have fairly\nsignificant increase in consumer-oriented mix in FQ3.\n\n\nWe had highlighted -- when we provided guidance for FQ3 last quarter, we\nhighlighted to you that we would be having a significant increase in our\nconsumer mix. And that has been driven by the fact that it took several\nquarters for the inventories in client and smartphones to get to healthy\nlevels after being heavy in inventory in the second half of calendar 2024.\nAnd we were shipping into these markets on the consumer side at a very low\nrate compared to the ship out rate from these markets because of that\ninventory level. So when that inventory level became normalized, our growth\nrate in FQ3 has suddenly jumped in a lot of these consumer end markets,\nwhich carry lower price points. So even though we have had very steady\npricing on the HBM front and like-for-like pricing increases, the mix\nchange has been so sharp that it has caused the impacts on the high-level\npricing that we were observing in the numbers.\n\n\nTimothy Michael Arcuri\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\n\nRight. So the message is that HBM price was still up. It's that the non-HBM\nprice was down such that the blended ASP was down low single digits. That's\nthe message, correct?\n\n\nSumit Sadana\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nYes. I mean the message is that the HBM pricing is steady, and the pricing\nwe have on the DRAM side like-for-like has improved sequentially. And it's\nreally the mix change on the consumer side that has done this. Now we spoke\nabout this on the DRAM side. But of course, on the NAND side, we have some\ndifferent dynamics, including the fact that the market environment is not\nas healthy as it is on the DRAM side, it's a more challenging environment\non the NAND side. And so the NAND dynamics are different. But I just wanted\nto make sure that I clarify that the DRAM dynamics are very healthy.\n\n\nTimothy Michael Arcuri\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\n\nTotally. Totally great. And then just one last quick one, just on the cost.\nSo costs had to be down a lot in both DRAM and NAND, had to be down like\nmid-single digits in both, definitely better than what I would have\nthought. Why was that? I know, Mark, you talked about these NAND headwinds,\nbut it seems like they weren't anywhere near as bad as what you thought\nthey'd be. So how do the costs work so that they were down so much?\n\n\nManish H. Bhatia\nExecutive Vice President of Global Operations\n\nMark? And then I'll add some color.\n\n\nMark J. Murphy\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nYes. I would just say, Tim, that I mean, mix affects costs, as you know.\nAnd so there's some of those effects. I think just on costs overall, front-\nend bit cost reductions, HBM and DRAM and for NAND, they're generally on\ntrack with the front-end cost reduction ranges that we've talked about\nbefore. So I think if you're looking to model things going forward, I think\nthat's something to keep in mind.\n\n\nOur business is changing to this mix issue. Our business is changing with\nour focus on the higher performance part of the market. Sometimes that has\nsome higher costs associated with it, but it's higher margin. And so we get\nhigher value out of that. And again, the mix is really affecting the cost.\nSo you'll see us move away from -- traditionally, what we would do is drill\ninto the cost detail every call because it's becoming a harder metric to\nfollow with the improving mix that we are driving in the business.\n\n\nManish H. Bhatia\nExecutive Vice President of Global Operations\n\nAnd Tim, I'll just add a little. I mean, I mentioned on the call that our\nHBM 12-high yields are doing better than our initial HBM 8-high ramp was a\nyear ago at this time and better than our expectations. So overall HBM came\nin a little better than our expectations last quarter. And there were\ncertain other areas that Mark and Sanjay both commented on a little bit\nthat our cost performance was operationally better. But as Mark mentioned,\na lot of it is due to mix.\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our final question today comes from the line of Chris Danely from Citi.\n\n\n\nUnknown Analyst\n\nThis is James filling in for Chris. I just had one question. I think it was\nprobably about a conference a couple of months ago, but you said the August\nquarter gross margins could be flattish to slightly up compared to this\nquarter. Was there any major change in that other than some pricing and you\ntalked about the data center mix? But just wanted to dig on that.\n\n\nMark J. Murphy\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nYes. I think I covered this on the main call that when we provide that\nguidance, it was in a period of transition. We did know that inventory\noutlook was improving. And we indicated on that call that we intended to\nwork to inflect price. The conditions of the market are just better than we\nexpected when we gave that guidance. And our performance, particularly on\nprice relative to what we thought the market would bear was better. And\nthen that's carrying into the fourth quarter. So you reset the baseline, we\ndid 39% versus our guide of 36.5%. And so from that baseline of 39%, we're\nseeing still a constructive market environment, particularly in DRAM or\nespecially in DRAM. And then we're -- so we're still focused on price. But\nthe 39% to 42% guide, the majority of that is driven by favorable mix\neffects. So more DRAM growth relative NAND and, if we cut by markets, more\ndata center than consumer-oriented mix.\n\n\nOperatorThis does conclude the question-and-answer session as well as\ntoday's program.

Now there is no impact of pull-ins in this assessment because whatever modest amount of pull-in there might have been, for example, in CQ2 from CQ3 or FQ3 from FQ4, et cetera, that kind of pull-in activity is net neutral for the full calendar year view. So the improvement is not impacted by any kind of pull-in activity. The strength in our view of the AI business, i.e., the data center growth, continues to be pretty robust. And our view of the AI demand is certainly supportive of the forecast that we have provided you for bit growth in calendar '25. And the other positive thing that has happened over the last 3 months is that we are seeing, after many, many quarters of a very challenging environment in the broad distribution markets, industrial markets and some parts of the automotive market, we are now starting to see really good improvements in demand in these broad distribution and industrial markets. And that is also providing a tailwind to the overall calendar '25 bit growth estimates."

I would add that we stand at record levels of cash and record levels of liquidity for the company. We're at $15.7 billion of liquidity, including our untapped facility. So we're in a great position to first continue to invest in the priorities of the business, maintaining our technology leadership, investing in needed capacity in DRAM to serve HBM and other high-value, high-return markets and then do return capital to shareholders through our routine dividend, which we hope to grow over time, and then opportunistic repurchase. So I think the balance sheet is in a great spot now, and we have a lot of flexibility. And on a covenant basis, I would add that we're actually basically at no leverage on a covenant basis."

I think last quarter, we talked a little bit about start- up costs and the potential for underutilization flowing through inventory on the NAND flash business. Obviously, demand dynamics have improved. I'm just curious, how should we think about those inputs to gross margin over the next couple of quarters? And then I'll just ask my second question right out of the gate. The LPDDR business in the data center side, we've talked for several quarters about you being predominantly the sole provider of those solutions into some of the AI silicon. I guess how do we think about that business as it progresses to $1 billion plus of quarterly revenue? I think you've alluded to in the past as far as diversity of customer base there. Has that expanded? Do you see a broadening market for that solution in data center?"

And over the past 6 months, we sort of worked -- the last call, the March call, we talked about how the structural capacity had come down and that we weren't incurring those period costs, they would end up being absorbed in inventories and pass-through. And that's what's happening. We have structurally lowered capacity in NAND, and those costs all now just passed through on inventories. The NAND volumes were very strong. So we're benefiting from some more loading there. But still, we're very careful about capacity in that market because that part of the business, the market environment is challenging. So again, we talk about low CapEx levels, careful about node transition, where our bits are going and premium products in that market and watching inventories carefully. Inventories improved in NAND actually in the quarter, but they remain less healthy than DRAM, which DRAM, we actually expect to be below target by the end of the year. As it relates to the start-up costs that I mentioned last quarter, we do see those beginning to increase, and very modestly now, but through '26, we'll see some increase related to -- as you know, we're building Idaho 1, and we'll begin to see those beginning to increase in '26. We also see some FX-related costs. I mean, everybody knows that the dollar has been weakening, and so we're seeing a bit more of that. But since we made those comments, the revenue outlook that we have is much higher. So those effects are 1 basis point less than what we talked about on the last call. Now I think that will have me reinforce, what's important is are we growing and we are positioning our bits in the right place. And we serve a market that's growing, and we're getting leverage on those costs. And then our price performance is critical. So we've done a great job of pricing in this market that's turning and becoming more constructive and which is why we have a strong guide in the fourth quarter of 42%. And then we feel positive about the trajectory of the business beyond that."

So in terms of 2026 HBM, we do expect that HBM bit growth in '26 over 2025 calendar year will be significantly faster than the overall DRAM bit growth. So HBM will continue to outrun the DRAM bit growth. Now when it comes to the actual discussions with customers, compared to this time last year, of course, we provided you a lot of details about 2025 expectations, and a lot of updates on color every quarter on what kind of milestones we were reaching on HBM, and what kind of capacity ramp and yield improvements and percentage growth rates on quarters, and $1 billion quarter, 50% growth after that in FQ3 from that $1 billion quarter in FQ2, et cetera, $1 billion-plus quarter in FQ2. So we have provided you a lot of these data points over the last several quarters because we were still in the process of ramping our capacity and ramping our revenue and ramping our scale in HBM. Of course, HBM is now over a $6 billion run rate business for us based on the last quarter's reported numbers. And so we are now at a place where we can not only offer customers with our HBM products, world's best technology based on our very mature capability in 1-beta node, but also the best power consumption capabilities. So we have not only that, which we also had last year, but we also now have the capacity in place and the scale in place to be able to meet their growing demand. So we have earned the trust of our customers. We have terrific engagements with all of the major HBM consumers in the world, and we are deeply embedded in their road maps, not just for HBM4, which we had just sampled, but also for HBM4E, where we have multiyear R&D engagements to do co-design work that relate to the custom- based die that HBM4E will have. So we are very excited about the growth opportunity. We are very confident about our place in the competitive landscape. We are very happy and glad to see the contributions of our team on the execution front from ramping the high-quality output to getting the financial benefits of growing this business in our portfolio. In terms of the discussions with the customers, our customers are going through a lot of rapid transitions. We're going from 8-high to 12-high that is in progress right now on HBM3. HBM4 has been sampled to them by us, and they are considering the timing of their platform transitions that will leverage HBM4. And they're still -- most of our customers are still in the process of finalizing their plans for 2026 in terms of the transition time lines of their key platforms, which will then determine the mix of products they have to purchase. And HBM products, as you know, come with very different type of lead times than the rest of the business. We like to ensure that when we start these wafers, we have very good visibility to the demand and good agreement and understanding with our customers on what volumes they will take in what time frame. And consequently, our customers have a higher bar in terms of providing those forecasts to us, a higher bar of fidelity of quality of those forecasts. And so they have to go through the assessment of what their platform transition timings will be, what their volumes by product will be. And that business, as it has scaled, has become much more complex due to its scale. And we are just going through those discussions with those customers. And as and when these agreements -- as and when we have the full visibility to all of these numbers and the agreements will fall in place, then we have confidence that we will end up with a terrific trajectory of our HBM business."

I think I had mentioned earlier in the call, I'll take your second part of the question first, I had mentioned in the earlier part of the call that the improvement in the DRAM outlook for the calendar year 2025 has nothing to do with any kind of tariff-related movement that may have occurred for some customers. It has a lot to do with the fact that we continue to see robust demand driven by AI in the data center. This is not just HBM demand, but all data center-related DRAM demand. We are seeing improvements from the CQ1 levels of data center SSD type of demand there as well. But really, the other area of improvement beyond the data center in DRAM has come from our improved view of what's happening in the industrial and broad distribution markets. These markets have not grown much for many quarters, and you have seen that view across the semiconductor industry. But now these markets seem to be improving their growth trajectory, firming up their growth forecast. So that's helping 2025 view of DRAM growth. Now as it relates to the tariffs and what some customers may have done, first, I just wanted to reiterate that whatever impact tariffs may have had on customer order patterns, we think that overall impact is fairly modest in our FQ3 numbers. And we actually are not too concerned about what the tariff-related impact has been because the customer -- our customers' aggregate demand signals for the remainder of calendar 2025 continue to be healthy. And so we feel like we are in a constructive demand environment for the next -- for the remaining part of calendar '25. And of course, there is uncertainty related to tariffs and whatever may hence happen to the macro environment, and we are mindful of that uncertainty, but we also know that we are one of the most agile businesses out there in responding to any changes that may occur. So with that said, the tariff-related movement from certain customers may have mainly been to stage inventory of their own finished goods in different parts in different geographies and that may have created some need for memory products in terms of a pull-in effect. But again, the overall impact fairly modest."

And just to reiterate, we're building our HBM4 on our now 2-years-old 1- beta technology, very, very proven, very strong performing product and where, similarly, our logic die is going to be built internally.

So I get that the HBM ASP -- or sorry, that the non-HBM ASP would have come down because of the mix to consumer. But why would the HBM ASP have come down? Because it had to come down a lot for overall DRAM pricing to be down. If half of the dollar growth came from HBM, pricing had to be down in HBM. So why would that have been the case?

I think if you look at our results, and particularly, I'll point you to the growth in our mobile business, which has been very significant, the price points in mobile tend to be quite low compared to data center. And so definitely, when you look at the overall mix -- and the mobile business is a pretty sizable business. It's not a trivial business. It's a large part of the TAM as well. And so when you look at the overall effect, on a like-for-like basis, we have improved pricing, we have growth in HBM happening, but we also have fairly significant increase in consumer-oriented mix in FQ3. We had highlighted -- when we provided guidance for FQ3 last quarter, we highlighted to you that we would be having a significant increase in our consumer mix. And that has been driven by the fact that it took several quarters for the inventories in client and smartphones to get to healthy levels after being heavy in inventory in the second half of calendar 2024. And we were shipping into these markets on the consumer side at a very low rate compared to the ship out rate from these markets because of that inventory level. So when that inventory level became normalized, our growth rate in FQ3 has suddenly jumped in a lot of these consumer end markets, which carry lower price points. So even though we have had very steady pricing on the HBM front and like-for-like pricing increases, the mix change has been so sharp that it has caused the impacts on the high-level pricing that we were observing in the numbers."

I think it was probably about a conference a couple of months ago, but you said the August quarter gross margins could be flattish to slightly up compared to this quarter. Was there any major change in that other than some pricing and you talked about the data center mix? But just wanted to dig on that."

      "text": "Executive VP & CFO Yes. I think I covered this on the main call that when we provide that guidance, it was in a period of transition. We did know that inventory outlook was improving. And we indicated on that call that we intended to work to inflect price. The conditions of the market are just better than we expected when we gave that guidance. And our performance, particularly on price relative to what we thought the market would bear was better. And then that's carrying into the fourth quarter. So you reset the baseline, we did 39% versus our guide of 36.5%. And so from that baseline of 39%, we're seeing still a constructive market environment, particularly in DRAM or especially in DRAM. And then we're -- so we're still focused on price. But the 39% to 42% guide, the majority of that is driven by favorable mix effects. So more DRAM growth relative NAND and, if we cut by markets, more data center than consumer-oriented mix. OperatorThis does conclude the question-and-answer session as well as today's program.
