Ramsay\nVice President of Financial Strategy & Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and welcome to AMD's 2025 First Quarter Financial Results\nConference Call. By now, you should have had the opportunity to review a\ncopy of our earnings press release and the accompanying slides. If you have\nnot had the chance to review these materials, they can be found on the\nInvestor Relations portion of amd.com.\n\n\nWe will refer primarily to non-GAAP financial measures during today's call.\nThe full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations are available in today's press\nrelease and the slides posted on our website.\n\n\nParticipants on today's conference call are Dr. Lisa Su, our Chair and\nChief Executive Officer; and Jean Hu, Executive Vice President, Chief\nFinancial Officer and Treasurer. This is a live call and will be replayed\nvia webcast on our website.\n\n\nBefore we begin, I would like to take note that Mark Papermaster, our\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, will attend the TD\nCowen TMT Conference on Wednesday, May 28. And Jean Hu will attend the Bank\nof America Global Technology Conference on Tuesday, June 3.\n\n\nToday's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on our current\nbeliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only of today, and as such,\ninvolve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ\nmaterially from our current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary\nstatement on our press release for more information on factors that could\ncause actual results to differ materially. You will also find a detailed\ndiscussion of our risk factors in our filings with the SEC, in particular,\nAMD's most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q and annual report on Form\n10-K.\n\n\nAnd with that, I would like to hand the call over to Lisa.\n\n\nLisa T. Su\nChair, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Matt, and good afternoon to all those listening today.\n\n\nWe delivered an outstanding start to the year despite the evolving dynamics\nrelated to tariffs and the regulatory environment. Growth accelerated for\nthe fourth consecutive quarter year-over-year driven by strength in our\ncore businesses and expanding data center and AI momentum.\n\n\nRevenue and EPS both exceeded consensus estimates as Instinct AI\naccelerator, EPYC and Ryzen CPU sales grew significantly year-over-year. As\na result, first quarter revenue increased 36% year-over-year to $7.4\nbillion as our Data Center and Client & Gaming segments both grew by a\nlarge double-digit percentage.\n\n\nWe expanded gross margin year-over-year for the fifth straight quarter and\nincreased net income by 55% driven by a higher overall percentage of Data\nCenter product sales and a richer Ryzen processor mix.\n\n\nDespite the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, our first quarter performance\nhighlights the strength of our differentiated product portfolio and\nexecution and positions us well for strong growth in 2025.\n\n\nTurning to the segments. Data Center segment revenue increased 57% year-\nover-year to $3.7 billion. We gained server CPU share driven by the ramp of\nour latest fifth-gen EPYC Turin processors and sustained demand for 4th Gen\nEPYC. Hyperscaler demand remains strong as cloud providers expanded EPYC\ndeployments to power their critical infrastructure and public services.\nMore than 30 new instances launched from Alibaba, AWS, Google, Oracle,\nTencent, and others in the quarter, including the initial wave of 5th Gen\nEPYC Turin instances.\n\n\nIn addition, AWS launched new FPGA accelerated instances in the quarter,\npowered by EPYC processors with Xilinx Virtex FPGAs that are optimized for\ndata and compute-intensive workloads like genomics, multimedia processing,\nnetwork security and cloud-based video broadcasting. Every major cloud\nprovider is deep in development on Turin programs with a steady stream of\npublic instances and internal deployments expected to ramp into production\nover the coming quarters.\n\n\nEnterprise adoption of EPYC instances was very strong in the quarter. The\nnumber of EPYC-powered cloud instances activated by Forbes 2000 enterprise\ncustomers more than doubled year-over-year, including new wins with\nInternet native streaming, transportation, financial services, and social\nmedia companies. For example, CrowdStrike achieved major performance in\ncost improvements by broadly deploying EPYC instances across its multi-\ncloud infrastructure.\n\n\nAt the same time, we're also actively partnering with leading application\nand cloud providers to deploy EPYC-optimized solutions tailored for\nspecialized industry verticals. Siemens launched their latest software-\ndefined vehicle solution powered by EPYC CPUs and Radeon Pro GPUs on Azure,\nleveraging digital twin technology to significantly speed up automotive\ndesign and validation.\n\n\nOracle launched a new version of its Exadata database platform, which is\nused by more than half of the Fortune Global 100. The latest Exadata X11M\nhas been optimized for 5th Gen EPYC processors to deliver up to 25% faster\nperformance in transaction processing and analytics compared to the prior\ngeneration.\n\n\nTurning to enterprise on-prem adoption. EPYC CPU sales grew by a large\ndouble-digit percentage year-over-year for the seventh straight quarter\ndriven by new public sector wins and high-volume deployments with large\nautomotive, semiconductor, financial services, retail, energy, and\ntechnology companies.\n\n\nWe have built significant enterprise momentum over the last few years as\nour partners expanded the number of EPYC-based platforms to more than 450\nand we scaled our joint go-to-market programs. As a result, EPYC is now\ndeployed by all of the top 10 telecom, aerospace, and semiconductor\ncompanies, 9 out of the top 10 automotive, 7 out of the top 10\nmanufacturing, and 6 out of the top 10 energy companies on the Forbes 2000.\nWe expect enterprise adoption to accelerate over the coming quarters as\nmore than 150 Turin platforms become broadly available from Dell, Cisco,\nHPE, Lenovo, Super Micro and others.\n\n\nLooking forward, we see a clear path to continued share gains as customers\nramp their 5th Gen EPYC offerings that deliver unmatched performance,\nefficiency and TCO across every major cloud and enterprise data center\nworkload. We passed key milestones in April to begin manufacturing 5th Gen\nEPYC at TSMC's new Arizona fab, with first production shipments expected in\nthe second half of 2025. Longer term, we announced our next-gen EPYC Venice\nprocessors, our lead HPC products for TSMC's 2-nanometer process node.\nVenice silicon is in our labs and performing well with bring-up and\nvalidation progressing to support a 2026 launch.\n\n\nTurning to our Data Center AI business. Revenue increased by a significant\ndouble-digit percentage year-over-year as MI325X shipments ramped to\nsupport new enterprise and cloud deployments. More than 35 MI300 Series\nplatforms are in production from all the leading service providers,\nsupporting the expanding number of Instinct GPU deployments with cloud,\nenterprise and AI customers. Several hyperscalers expanded their use of\nInstinct accelerators to cover an increasing range of generative AI search,\nranking and recommendation use cases. We also added multiple Tier 1 cloud\nand enterprise customers in the quarter, including one of the largest\nfrontier model developers that is now using Instinct GPUs to serve a\nsignificant portion of their daily inference traffic.\n\n\nThe depth and breadth of our customer engagements continues to expand as\nbreakthroughs in large-scale AI models like OpenAI's o3 and DeepSeek's R1\ndrive increased demand for traditional inferencing and increasingly, as a\ncritical part of pretraining. The industry-leading memory capacity and\nbandwidth of our Instinct portfolio is ideally suited for these workloads,\nand we are actively working with multiple customers to scale Instinct from\nsingle-node deployments to distributed inferencing clusters.\n\n\nTraining engagements also ramped in the quarter as multiple Tier 1\nhyperscale, AI and enterprise customers scaled Instinct GPU clusters to\ntrain internal and frontier models. In parallel, we're making meaningful\nprogress with sovereign AI deployments as countries expand investments to\nestablish domestic nation-scale AI infrastructure. In February, we\nannounced a strategic partnership with G42 to build one of France's most\npowerful AI compute facilities powered by Instinct accelerators.\n\n\nOn the AI software front, we significantly accelerated our release cadence\nin the first quarter, shifting from quarterly ROCm updates to delivering\nready to deploy training and inferencing containers on a biweekly basis\nthat include performance optimizations and support for the latest\nlibraries, kernels and algorithms. We expanded our open source community\nenablement in the quarter, making significantly more Instinct compute\ninfrastructure available to enable developers to automatically build, test,\nand deploy updates to ROCm code nightly. As a result, more than 2 million\nmodels on Hugging Face now run out of the box on AMD.\n\n\nWe're also enabling an increasing number of models to launch with Day Zero\nsupport for Instinct accelerators, including Meta's Llama 4, Google's Gemma\n3, and DeepSeek's R1 models that were released in the first quarter.\n\n\nBeyond launch, we are delivering regular software updates that increase\nperformance for new models. For example, in the weeks following the launch\nof DeepSeek's R1 model, we introduced ROCm optimizations that enabled MI300\nto deliver leadership inferencing throughput. We released ROCm 6.4 in the\nquarter with major upgrades that increased training and inferencing\nperformance across popular AI frameworks like PyTorch, JAX and vLLM. The\nrelease also adds multiple ease-of-use features, including new cluster\nmanagement tools that simplify the scaling and optimization of large-scale\nInstinct deployments.\n\n\nTurning to our AI solutions capabilities. Earlier this quarter, we\ncompleted our acquisition of ZT Systems, adding world-class systems design\nexpertise to complement our silicon and software leadership. With ZT, we\ncan provide ready-to-deploy rack-level AI solutions based on industry\nstandards built with AMD CPUs, GPUs and networking, reducing deployment\ntime for hyperscalers and accelerating time to market for OEM and ODM\npartners. The team is fully engaged and already co-designing with key\ncustomers and rack-level designs optimized for our upcoming MI400 series\nand working with customers and OEM partners to accelerate time to market\nfor our MI350 series. We have received significant interest in ZT's\nmanufacturing business and expect to announce a strategic partner shortly.\n\n\nWe began sampling our next-gen MI350 series with multiple customers in the\nfirst quarter and remain on track to begin accelerated production by\nmidyear. MI350 Series performance is very strong based on the advances in\nour CDNA 4 architecture. We designed CDNA 4 to deliver leadership\nperformance across a wide range of AI workloads, increasing memory capacity\nand bandwidth 1.5x, adding support for new data types and improving network\nefficiency to deliver 35x higher throughput and performance compared to\nMI300x. Customer interest in the MI350 Series is very strong, setting the\nstage for broad deployment in the second half of this year. As one example,\nwe are partnering with Oracle to deploy a large-scale cluster powered by\nMI355x accelerators, 5th Gen EPYC Turin processors and Pollara 400 AI NICs.\nThis multibillion-dollar initiative highlights the expanding AMD and OCI\npartnership and the growing demand for AMD Instinct to power the next wave\nof large-scale AI infrastructure.\n\n\nLooking ahead, our MI400 Series development remains on track to launch next\nyear. The MI400 Series is designed to deliver leadership performance for\nboth inferencing and training, scaling seamlessly from single servers to\nfull data center deployments. Early customer feedback has been very\npositive, marking a major step forward in our Instinct road map and\nsignificantly expanding our AI accelerator TAM as customers plan broader\nInstinct deployments to power a larger share of their AI infrastructure.\n\n\nI'm looking forward to sharing more details on the MI350 Series, future\nMI400 rack-scale solutions and the growing customer adoption of our\nInstinct platforms at our Advancing AI event on June 12.\n\n\nTurning to our Client & Gaming segment. Segment revenue increased 28% year-\nover-year to $2.9 billion. Client revenue grew 68% year-over-year, marking\nour fifth consecutive quarter of revenue share gains. We delivered record\nclient CPU ASP driven by a richer mix of high-end desktop and mobile Ryzen\nprocessors. Desktop channel sell-out increased by more than 50% year-over-\nyear. We set new sell-out records in multiple regions as our latest-\ngeneration Ryzen processors became the CPU of choice for gamers, topping\nbestseller lists at leading global e-tailers. To build on this momentum, we\nextended our desktop CPU portfolio with the launch of our 16-core Ryzen\n9950X 3D processor that delivers significantly higher gaming and\nproductivity performance than the competition.\n\n\nIn mobile, AMD-based notebook sell-through was very strong in the quarter.\nWe also saw strong demand for our latest generation AI PC processors as\nsales ramped, increasing by more than 50% quarter-on-quarter. The first\nnotebooks powered by our new high-end Ryzen AI MAX+ and the first\nmainstream Ryzen AI 7 and 5 300 Series processors launched to very positive\nreviews. These new processors set the standard for traditional computing\nand graphics performance while also delivering unmatched AI capabilities in\nbattery life, positioning Ryzen as a CPU of choice for gaming, ultrathin\nand commercial notebooks.\n\n\nDemand for AMD-based commercial PCs was also very strong in the quarter.\nRyzen PRO PC sell-through grew more than 30% year-over-year driven by new\nend customer wins and an 80% increase from 2024 in the number of AMD-\npowered commercial systems from HP, Lenovo, Dell and Asus. We closed\nmultiple wins with large auto, energy, health care, financial services and\ntelecom companies in the quarter. Looking more broadly across the PC\nmarket, we remain confident we can grow client processor revenue well ahead\nof the market in 2025 led by expanding adoption of our desktop channel and\nconsumer and commercial notebook portfolio as well as a richer mix.\n\n\nTurning to our Gaming business results. Gaming revenue decreased 30% year-\nover-year as higher Radeon graphics sales were more than offset by low semi-\ncustom sales. While our semi-custom SoC sales declined year-over-year,\nconsole channel inventories have normalized as demand sales have\nstrengthened for 2025. For PC gaming, we launched our Radeon 9070 series to\nstrong demand as our new RDNA 4 architecture delivers leadership\nperformance for mainstream gamers. First week sell-out set a record and was\nmore than 10x higher than our previous best Radeon launch. Demand remains\nvery strong, and we are working closely with our board partners to\nreplenish inventory weekly and need to sustain demand.\n\n\nWe also introduced FSR 4, our first machine learning-based rendering\ntechnology that delivers significantly higher frame rates and more\nimmersive gaming experiences. FSR 4 is already enabled in over 30 games\nwith support expected to reach 75 titles by year-end.\n\n\nTurning to our Embedded segment. First quarter revenue decreased 3% year-\nover-year to $823 million. Embedded demand continues to recover gradually.\nWe expect improving demand in the test and measurement, communications and\naerospace markets will drive a return to growth in the second half of 2025.\nWe completed initial shipments of our cost-optimized Spartan UltraScale+\nFPGAs and second-generation Versal AI Edge SoCs to meet growing demand for\nAI at the Edge.\n\n\nAs a part of continuing to grow our Embedded x86 business, we launched our\nEPYC Embedded 9005 Series CPUs that deliver leadership performance for\nnetworking, storage and industrial edge applications. Cisco selected our\nnew EPYC Embedded processors for their latest high-end firewall solutions,\nand IBM is using them to power its latest storage-scale System 6000 for\nperformance-intensive enterprise analytics and AI workloads. We also\nreleased our latest Vitis AI software suite, expanding support for the\nlatest models and accelerating Edge AI deployment across a broader range of\napplications, further strengthening our leadership in the rapidly emerging\nEdge AI market.\n\n\nIn summary, our strong first quarter results and second quarter outlook\nreflect the momentum we are building across our business. While we face\nsome headwinds from the dynamic macro and regulatory environments,\nincluding the recently announced export controls for Instinct MI308X\nshipments to China, we believe they are more than offset by the powerful\ntailwinds from our leadership product portfolio. Against this backdrop, we\nremain confident we can deliver strong double-digit percentage revenue\ngrowth in 2025 based on accelerating share gains with our latest generation\nof Zen 5 EPYC and Ryzen CPUs and Radeon GPUs and ramping production of our\nInstinct MI350 Series accelerators in the second half of the year to\nsupport an expanded set of customers and AI workloads.\n\n\nWe also expect full year growth in our semi-custom business, and for our\nEmbedded business to return to year-over-year growth, in the second half of\nthe year driven by the reduced inventory levels and improving demand\nenvironment.\n\n\nTo capitalize on our unprecedented growth opportunities and deliver our\nnext major growth arc, we are expanding investments in our product and\ntechnology road maps, go-to-market initiatives and full stack AI software\nand data center scale solutions capabilities. We're also doubling down our\nexecution to deliver and, where possible, accelerate our industry-leading\nroad maps.\n\n\nWe view the current environment as a strategic opportunity to further\ndifferentiate AMD as we deliver an expanding product portfolio that combine\nleadership compute and AI capabilities for data centers, edge, PCs and\nembedded end devices.\n\n\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color\non our first quarter results. Jean?\n\n\nJean X. Hu\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of\nour financial results and then provide our current outlook for the second\nquarter of fiscal 2025. As a reminder, for comparative purposes, our first\nquarter fiscal year 2025 financial statement disclosures include the\ncombination of our Client & Gaming businesses into a single reportable\nsegment to align with how we manage the business. We continue to provide\ndistinct revenue disclosures for our Data Center, Client & Gaming and\nEmbedded businesses.\n\n\nWe are pleased with our record first quarter revenue of $7.4 billion,\nexceeding the high end of our guidance, up 36% year-over-year, driven by\n57% revenue growth in the Data Center segment and a 28% revenue growth in\nthe Client & Gaming segment. Revenue declined 3% sequentially due to lower\nrevenue in the Embedded and Data Center segments, partially offset by\nsequential growth in the Client & Gaming segment. Gross margin was 54%, up\n140 basis points from a year ago.\n\n\nOperating expenses were $2.2 billion, an increase of 28% year-over-year as\nwe continue to invest aggressively in go-to-market activities and in R&D to\naddress the significant growth opportunity ahead of us. Operating income\nwas $1.8 billion, representing a 24% operating margin. Taxes, interest\nexpenses and the other was $213 million.\n\n\nFor the first quarter of 2025, diluted earnings per share was $0.96, an\nincrease of 55% year-over-year.\n\n\nNow turning to our reportable segments, starting with the Data Center. Data\nCenter segment revenue was $3.7 billion, up 57% year-over-year, primarily\ndriven by continued CPU server share gains across both the cloud and\nenterprise customers and strong growth of AMD Instinct GPUs. On a\nsequential basis, Data Center segment revenue decreased 5%. Data Center\nsegment operating income was $932 million or 25% of revenue compared to\n$541 million or 23% a year ago.\n\n\nClient & Gaming segment revenue was $2.9 billion, up 28% year-over-year,\ndriven primarily by strong customer demand for our latest generation Zen 5\nAMD Ryzen processors, partially offset by lower semi-custom revenue. Client\nrevenue was $2.3 billion, up 68% year-over-year. More than half of the\ngrowth was driven by higher ASPs from a richer mix of high-end Ryzen\nprocessors. On a sequential basis, Client & Gaming segment revenue\nincreased by 2%, primarily driven by stronger-than-seasonal performance of\nour Client product portfolio and increased semi-custom product revenue.\nClient & Gaming segment operating income was $496 million or 17% of revenue\ncompared to $237 million or 10% a year ago driven by operating leverage on\nhigher revenue.\n\n\nEmbedded segment revenue was $823 million, down 3% year-over-year. Embedded\ndemand continues to recover gradually. Sequentially, Embedded was down 11%,\nconsistent with our expectations. Embedded segment operating income was\n$328 million or 40% of revenue compared to $342 million or 41% a year ago.\n\n\nTurning to the balance sheet and the cash flow. During the quarter, we\ngenerated $939 million in cash from operations, and our free cash flow for\nthe quarter was $727 million. We returned $749 million to shareholders\nthrough the repurchase of common stock in our repurchase program. We have\n$4 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization.\n\n\nAt the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents and short-term\ninvestments was $7.3 billion. Within the quarter, we reached $1.5 billion\nof debt and issued $950 million of commercial paper to help fund our\nacquisition of ZT Systems, which was completed on March 31.\n\n\nNow turning to our second quarter 2025 outlook. As a reminder, in April, a\nnew export license requirement was put in place for MI308 shipments to\nChina, the impact of which is included in our guidance. We expect revenue\nto be approximately $7.4 billion plus or minus $300 million. This includes\nan estimated $700 million revenue reduction as a result of the new export\nlicense requirement. Despite this headwind, the midpoint of our guidance\nrepresents 27% year-over-year revenue growth.\n\n\nFor the full year 2025, we estimate the revenue impact due to the export\nlicense requirement to be approximately $1.5 billion. Sequentially, we\nexpect Client & Gaming segment revenue to increase by double-digit\npercentage, Embedded segment revenue to be flattish, and we expect Data\nCenter segment revenue to decrease due to the exclusion of MI308 revenue.\n\n\nIn addition, we expect second quarter non-GAAP gross margin is estimated to\nbe 43%, inclusive of approximately $800 million in charges for inventory\nand related reserves. Excluding this charge, our non-GAAP gross margin\nwould be approximately 54%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately\n$2.3 billion, which includes approximately $50 million in OpEx due to the\naddition of the ZT Systems design team. The financials for the ZT\nmanufacturing business will be reported as discontinued operations starting\nin the second quarter.\n\n\nWe expect net interest and other expenses to be $5 million due to the debt\nassociated with the ZT System transaction; non-GAAP effective tax rate to\nbe 13% and the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.64\nbillion shares, which includes 9 million shares related to the ZT\ntransaction.\n\n\nLooking forward, despite ongoing macro and trade policy-related\nuncertainties, we believe the investments we are making will position us\nwell to address the large growth opportunities ahead as AI expand the use\nof high-performance computing across all our end markets.\n\n\nIn closing, 2025 is off to a strong start as we continue to execute on key\nstrategic and financial goals. We delivered strong top line revenue growth,\nexpanded gross and operating margins and closed the key acquisition of ZT\nSystems to expand and accelerate our Data Center GPU and the systems road\nmaps.\n\n\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Matt for the Q&A session.\n\n\nMatthew D. Ramsay\nVice President of Financial Strategy & Investor RelationsThank you very\nmuch, Jean. John, can you go ahead and pool the callers for the Q&A\nsession, please?\n\n\nQuestion and Answer\n\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of\nJoshua Buchalter with TD Cowen.\n\n\nJoshua Louis Buchalter\nTD Cowen, Research Division\n\nCongrats on the results. I was hoping you can maybe expand on the drivers\nof upside in both the print and in particular, the guide. How should we\nthink about 2Q growth by segment? And wanted to double-click on Client in\nparticular. That business is up 67% year-over-year in the first quarter,\nand there's obviously a lot of concerns on pull-in. So I was hoping you\ncould walk through some of the drivers of the strength in Client in\nparticular and how you're thinking about that in 2Q.\n\n\nLisa T. Su\nChair, President & CEO\n\nOkay. Great, Josh. Thanks for the question. Look, we were very pleased with\nour performance in Q1. We actually saw strength across a number of our\nbusinesses. We saw strength certainly in the Client business, very strong\ndesktop performance. We saw strength in our gaming business as well, which\nwas really due to our strong Radeon launch. And we also saw some strength\nin our Data Center business across both stronger CPU and GPU. So those are\nsome of the drivers for our Q1 performance.\n\n\nAnd in particular, on your question of Client performance, we've certainly\nlooked very carefully at the ordering patterns and what customers are\ntelling us. We have not seen a lot of tariff-related activity in that\nbusiness. I would say, though, what we have seen is a real stronger mix and\nstrength in our overall ASPs. So the desktop channel, which is an area\nwhere we have a very strong gaming products right now, actually performed\nwell above seasonality in Q1, and that is really the strength of the ASPs\nthere. So that's what we saw in Q1.\n\n\nAnd then to your question about the guide for Q2, as Jean mentioned, we do\nhave the new export control limitation on MI308. So we have taken out that\nrevenue, which is a $700 million headwind in Q2. But with that, we have a\nstrong outlook given the strength across the rest of our businesses. So we\ncontinue to see strength in Client going into the second quarter. Again,\nthe desktop business continues to perform above typical seasonality. We're\nalso seeing the beginning of the commercial ramp, which is a place where we\nhave traditionally been quite underrepresented.\n\n\nWe see continued strength in Gaming, I would say, much better than typical\nseasonality. That is really our AIB business, with the Radeon products\nramping. As well as consoles have now drained all of their inventory, and\nso they are starting their ramp into the year. And from a Data Center side,\nwe see sequential growth on the CPU side. We see the GPU right on track\nminus the China export controls. And so for all of those reasons, we're\npleased with where the performance of the business is right now.\n\n\nJean X. Hu\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nYes. I'll just add 1 point to what Lisa just said on the Client business.\nWe had really strong performance in Q1. Sequentially, Client revenue is\nlargely flattish versus Q4. When you look behind it, our units actually\ndeclined double digit. So the revenue flattish is largely driven by the ASP\nincrease sequentially due to the richer mix Lisa just mentioned.\n\n\nJoshua Louis Buchalter\nTD Cowen, Research Division\n\nTo follow up, I wanted to ask about how the ex China, X308 (sic) [ 308X ]\nInstinct family performed in the quarter and how you're thinking about the\nback half of the year. I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks\nsignificant double-digit year-over-year. Could you maybe provide some color\non how Instinct did in the first quarter, how you're thinking about the\nfirst half ahead of the 350 ramp next month?\n\n\nLisa T. Su\nChair, President & CEO\n\nSure. So on the Instinct ramp, I would say Q1 performance of Data Center\nGPU was in line with maybe a little bit better than expected. I think the\nkey point that we've always said about the Instinct ramp is very excited\nabout the MI350 launch. We're right on track for that launching midyear. I\nwould say customer interest has been very high. So from a competitiveness\nstandpoint, we feel really good about where it's positioned. Overall, I\nthink one of the advantages that we have with the MI350 launch is that,\nfrom a systems overall environment, it's actually very similar to the\nMI300. So we believe it's going to ramp fast. And we already have a couple\nof deals that have been announced, including a very important relationship\nwith Oracle in terms of the MI350 series for a number of joint customers.\n\n\nSo we're excited about the overall AI business. I think we continue to see\nstrength there. I know there are some uncertainties as it relates to\ntariffs and other things. But this is one of those areas where, from an\ninfrastructure standpoint, there continues to be investment in AI\ninfrastructure. And so with that, we would expect strong growth into the\nsecond half of the year.\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\n\n\nTimothy Michael Arcuri\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\n\nLisa, you said that Data Center GPU grew significant double digit, but it\nwas like $600 million last March. So I would think that -- I mean, I think\na lot of us thought it was going to be like $1.7 billion to $1.75 billion.\nIs that the wrong way to sort of interpret that because it seems like it\nmore than -- it went up triple digits at least? So can you help us there?\nAnd also, I'm curious, the additional $100 million that sort of has to come\nout from the ban, does that all come out in September? Or is there some\nremnants to have to come out in the fourth quarter as well?\n\n\nLisa T. Su\nChair, President & CEO\n\nYes. So again, what I would say is the Data Center GPU business did perform\nvery well in the first quarter. I think we have to go back and look at what\nyou had for first quarter 2024. But overall standpoint, it performed right\nwhere we would expect. Relative to your conversation as to where does it\ncome out, I would say the vast majority already comes out in the September\nquarter. So think about -- Jean mentioned $1.5 billion. You would see the\nmajority of it in Q2 and Q3 with very little in Q4. So we had always\nexpected that the fourth quarter, because it would be very focused on the\nMI350 family, would be non-China revenue, and that's how it was planned.\n\n\nTimothy Michael Arcuri\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\n\nGot it. And then, Jean, just on the inventory, it was up a lot. Is that\njust due to ZT? Or is there something else happening there?\n\n\nJean X. Hu\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nWell, on the inventory side, we built some inventory primarily to support\nvery strong client and server ramp and also the second half Data Center GPU\nramp. As you probably know, the lead time is really long to build. For the\nQ3, Q4 ramp, we really need to start the wafers right now. That's why the\ninventory has increased.\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\n\n\nHarlan L.  Sur\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nI know there's been a lot of focus in your upcoming MI350 Series, Lisa, but\nMI400 next year is where you potentially close the competitive gap in a big\nway, right? You're bringing frontier class model training performance GPU\nin a rack-scale solution. More and more, the challenges has been standing\nup these rack-scale platforms, power, cooling, footprint, networking,\nconnectivity, telemetry, et cetera, right, lots of well-telegraphed issues\nwith standing up these rack-scale architectures. So as you've shared your\nMI400 rack-scale solution architecture with customers, like what is the AMD\nteam doing to potentially address the ease of these deployments with the\nMI400? And just in general, what's the overall feedback been like on MI400?\n\n\n\nLisa T. Su\nChair, President & CEO\n\nYes, Harlan, thank you for the question. I think, look, we're excited about\nthe MI350 Series launch that's coming up, but we are extremely excited as\nwell about the MI400 Series and the road map there. I think we've been very\nactive with customers on our road map. As you know, this is one of those\nareas where you absolutely have to be planning many quarters in advance for\nthat. One of the primary reasons we acquired ZT Systems was exactly to\naddress this rack-scale architecture. And so from that standpoint, the\nclosing of the ZT acquisition has been very timely. What we're doing right\nnow is, together with our ZT design team as well as our customers' design\nteams and our own systems design capability, really actively planning what\nthose rack-scale systems are going to look like.\n\n\nI would say the MI400 Series enthusiasm from customers is high. And there's\na lot of activities that are going on right now to ensure that we do, in\nfact, learn from some of the, let's call it, some of the challenges that\nhave occurred with some of the recent deployments.\n\n\nHarlan L.  Sur\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nAnd then I continue to be impressed, I mean, 7 consecutive quarters of\nstrong year-over-year growth in your EPYC enterprise and on-prem traction,\nright? You have high-30s, low-40s type share of the overall server market\nin enterprise and on-prem. Your share is probably in the sort of low-20%\nrange but significant share momentum. Can you just remind us like what has\nthe AMD team done? What have you put in place, sort of go-to-market wise,\nto drive the strong tailwind here in what has been a very, very tough\nmarket segment to crack?\n\n\nLisa T. Su\nChair, President & CEO\n\nI think there are a couple of things, Harlan. First of all, the strength of\nthe product cannot be undersold, right? At this moment, with 5th Gen EPYC,\nthe overall cloud adoption has been fantastic. And then on the enterprise\nside, we've really broadened the product portfolio for Turin that includes,\nlet's call it, low core count up through the highest core count and\nfrequency ranges. So that's very helpful.\n\n\nBut probably the largest impact has been in go-to-market. In the go-to-\nmarket space, we have added significant head count and capability to\naddress end users directly. And with the use cases, I think some of the\nthings that we talked about across industries, we're actually learning from\neach deployment and replicating that across many of the industrial\npartners. So overall, I think it's been a strong effort on enterprise. And\nwe're really still in the very early stages of that. I would say we're\nstill quite underrepresented in enterprise. But with the platform coverage\nand the processor coverage, I think we feel good about the opportunities.\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\n\n\n\nAaron Christopher Rakers\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\n\nGoing back to kind of the Data Center business and particularly the GPU\nbusiness, I think last quarter, you had alluded to the fact that you had\nexpected the Data Center revenue to be roughly flat in the first half of\nthe year. I guess if we were to take out the $700 million impact from\nChina, would the expectation still be flat for the year? Is that a fair\nassumption?\n\n\nJean X. Hu\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nAaron, so you're right. Last time, we did mention the first half Data\nCenter GPU, it's flattish versus second half. The way to think about it,\nwhat Lisa mentioned, is the $1.5 billion impact largely will be in Q2 and\nQ3. And so when you take out $700 million in Q2 and the majority in Q3,\nthat is what impacted in Q2 and Q3. But remember what Lisa mentioned is we\ndo see second half weighted, as we launch MI355, we will see significant\nramp. Year-over-year, we see strong double-digit growth of our Data Center\nbusiness and the GPU business also.\n\n\nAaron Christopher Rakers\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\n\nOkay. And then as a quick follow-up, kind of thinking about the gross\nmargin, obviously, this quarter's guidance is reflective of the charge that\nyou're taking. Should we assume that in the back half, with mix attributes\nto be considered, that you would see a return to that 54-plus percent gross\nmargin in the second half of the year. Is that a fair assessment?\n\n\nJean X. Hu\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nYes, Aaron, thank you for the question. Yes, there are a few puts and takes\non the gross margin. If you think about Q2, excluding $800 million charge\nrelated to MI308, our gross margin actually is around 54%. So at the\ncompany level, right, the mix is less favorable because the Client and the\nGaming business is growing sequentially, but we do have a few drivers to\ndrive the gross margin up. First, as I mentioned earlier, if you look at\nour Client business, the gross margin has been improving because the richer\nmix of our latest-generation product portfolio, that really helps. And also\nsecondly, within Data Center, when we expand the enterprise market share,\nwe do see gross margin improvement.\n\n\nOf course, in addition, MI308 Data Center GPU gross margin is on the low\nend for our Data Center GPU margin. So that also helps us overall, when we\nthink about the second half, we actually think the gross margin will\nimprove slightly because Data Center continues to be a very strong growth\ndriver, #1 growth driver, second half versus the first half, which will be\npartially offset by continued strength on the client and the gaming side.\nHope that answers your question.\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Thomas O'Malley with Barclays.\n\n\n\nThomas James O'Malley\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\n\nI just wanted to understand your view on system-based architectures and\nwhether you feel like you have what you need right now. Obviously, UALink\n1.0 is coming out. You can use third-party providers to kind of do the\ninterconnect. ZT Systems does do a lot for you in terms of the system\narchitecture. But from the interconnect side, do you think that you need\nmore? Is that something that you're going to do internally, look\nexternally? Just want to understand where you think the portfolio is today\nand whether you can address system-based architectures with what you have\ntoday.\n\n\nLisa T. Su\nChair, President & CEO\n\nTom, absolutely. I think we feel like we have all the pieces required as\nwell as deep partnerships in the ecosystem. And I consider it a system-\nlevel optimization between CPU, GPU networking capability, rack-scale\narchitecture. I think all of those pieces are things that we are investing\nin. And we're also partnering with others in the industry who are offering\nthese capabilities. I think when we look at the architectures that our\ncustomers want, our customers are really asking for one that we have a\nreference architecture that works but also that we work with them as they\nwant to interchange various pieces. Particularly on the networking side, I\nthink there are a couple of different solutions out there. And we are very\nmuch focused on ensuring that we interoperate across the spectrum.\n\n\nThomas James O'Malley\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\n\nHelpful. And then if we look at the full year, I mean, we'll get the units\nwith the filing, but it looks like there's some material share gains here\nin the first quarter. When you look at the full year, just to level set us\non share gains versus market growth, could you maybe talk about what you\nsee the Client business growing at a base level? And then just obviously,\nit's difficult to kind of predict where share will go. But just any\ncomments on what you're seeing thus far. Is a couple of points of shares\nkind of what you're seeing in the first quarter as well? We'll get a little\nmore later, but mostly just on the market growth for 2025.\n\n\nLisa T. Su\nChair, President & CEO\n\nSure, Tom. So if you're asking about share in the Client business, I think\nthat was the conversation, look, we are very pleased with our Client\nbusiness performance over the last couple of quarters. I think we are\nseeing unit growth, particularly in desktop, but where we're seeing\nprobably the most growth is overall revenue share. And so we're gaining\nshare in the right places, which is in sort of high-end notebook and\ncommercial as well as in desktop overall. So from that standpoint, that's\nwhere we think we're going.\n\n\nAs we go through the year, I know there's a good amount of conversation\nabout what happens in the macro and what happens with tariffs and does that\nchange things going forward. We are spending quite a bit of time ensuring\nthat we are aligning with our customers, looking at inventory levels,\nlooking at sort of consumption and overall sell-through. And we believe\nthat we have a good overall inventory position, and there is not, let's\ncall it, a tremendous amount of pull-ins or other things that are coming\ninto play. And we will continue to be very agile in how we look at that\ngoing forward.\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of\nAmerica Securities.\n\n\nVivek  Arya\nBofA Securities, Research Division\n\nI had 2 questions as well. On the first one, just near term, Lisa, your GPU\nsales grew sequentially in Q1? How much was MI308 in that number? And if\nyou look at 2025 overall, do you think GPUs can still grow despite this\nChina headwind that you've mentioned relative to the $5 billion-plus you\ndid last year?\n\n\nLisa T. Su\nChair, President & CEO\n\nYes, sure, Vivek. So let me answer the second question first. We absolutely\nbelieve the Data Center GPU will grow, and we think it will grow strong\ndouble digits. We had a plan that was second half weighted, and it still\nis. Relative to the MI308 situation, it's certainly a headwind, but one\nwhich we think is well contained given everything else that we have going\non. And relative to the Q1 performance of Data Center GPU, it was down very\nmodestly from Q4, which is what we expected. We did see good overall demand\nactually in the first quarter driven by MI325. So we had a significant\nadoption by a large foundational model company, which was very positive\nthere. And as we go forward, we expect that we will continue to broaden\nboth customers as well as workloads within our current customers for the\nInstinct portfolio.\n\n\nJean X. Hu\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nAnd Vivek, in Q1, MI325 and MI300 are a majority of our revenue.\n\n\nVivek  Arya\nBofA Securities, Research Division\n\nGreat. And then longer term, Lisa, in the past, you described, I believe,\nalmost a $500 billion or so addressable market for AI accelerators. How\nmuch of that roughly is China because that now seems to be somewhat\nrestricted for the U.S. companies? And then also kind of related to that,\nhow should we think about these AI diffusion rules that I think there is an\nimplementation date that is coming up on May 15. I'm curious what you have\nheard. So just sort of the implication of China restrictions and these AI\ndiffusion rules on thinking about the addressable opportunity for you\nlonger term.\n\n\nLisa T. Su\nChair, President & CEO\n\nYes, Vivek, I think it's a good question. I think overall, it is a very\ndynamic market, so you will appreciate that. On the China export controls,\nI think we always expected that there would be some amount of, let's call\nit, limitation on sort of leading-edge GPUs going into China. So that was\nfactored in to our TAM expectation when we talked about $500 billion. So I\ndon't think that dramatically changes the TAM.\n\n\nBut what I will say is, on the AI diffusion side, what we're very actively\nworking with the government, they're thinking through these rules, and it's\na very fine balance that we have to have. At the end of the day, when we\nlook at sort of the U.S. AI companies, we have leading-edge technology. We\nwant to ensure that the rest of the world can really use us as the primary\nplatform. So I think it will be important to work through the AI diffusion\nrules and all of that as we think about longer-term TAM. And we're\ncertainly spending quite a bit of efforts trying to ensure that it's well\nunderstood, the importance of the overall ecosystem and having the rest of\nthe world really adopt the U.S. ecosystem given our strength and leadership\noverall.\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor\nFitzgerald.\n\n\nChristopher James Muse\nCantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division\n\nI wanted to revisit your assumptions around Client. If you were to just\nflatline the Q1 actual, you would grow the business about 30%. You're\nobviously very bullish on taking share. You talked about huge tailwinds\nfrom ASPs. But curious, when you put it all together, how should we think\nabout traditional seasonality into the second half, particularly with the\npotential of some pull-ins here in the first half?\n\n\nLisa T. Su\nChair, President & CEO\n\nSure, C.J. It's a fair question. Look, we want to be very clear that our\nClient business performance is primarily driven by the strength of the\nproduct portfolio. And it's driven by some of the desktop channel products\nthat traditionally are not so well tracked if you look at sort of the IDCs\nof the world. We are planning for, let's call it, second half sub-seasonal\ngiven that we're off to such a strong start in the first half of the year.\nAnd that is what we're putting into our sort of internal planning number.\nSo you wouldn't see necessarily typical seasonality since the first half is\nbetter than seasonal.\n\n\nThat being the case, I think we feel strongly that, from a consumption\nbasis standpoint, we see the data. So when we look at the Q1 performance,\nit was a very, very strong Q1 in terms of sell-out and consumption for our\ndesktop business. And as we start Q2, we're now 4 weeks into it, we see\nthose patterns continuing. So we're in an upgrade cycle right now. Gaming\nCPUs are usually repurchased when there are gaming GPUs that come out in\nnew cycles. And I think we're benefiting from that on both the CPU and the\nGPU side, which is great. I mean, we're very happy with that, and we're\nramping up production to ensure that we keep the channel full.\n\n\nChristopher James Muse\nCantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division\n\nVery helpful. And then, I guess looking to next year, can you talk about\n400 Series and rack-level solution go-to-market strategy? You talked about\nkind of trying to obtain partners. Is there a certain number that you're\ntargeting? And then how are you thinking about kind of getting through some\nof the learning curve challenges of getting the rack-scale working with\nyour OEM partners such that you can deliver that ramp in 2026?\n\n\nLisa T. Su\nChair, President & CEO\n\nSure, C.J. So I think the right answer is we're getting a very early start,\nand that's what we have to do so that we maximize the overall learning\ncycle that is required for rack-scale solutions. We are working very\nclosely with a number of our hyperscale partners today to define those\nsolutions and make sure that we're thinking about all of the various areas\nthat could require work. And we're also working with our OEM partners who\nalso have, let's call it, learned quite a bit over the past couple of\nmonths and quarters as other rack-scale solutions have been coming online.\nSo I think we're doing everything to, let's call it, move ahead the\nlearning cycle. And again, we have the benefit of the MI350 Series being a\nrelatively, let's call it, not large lift. And so the focus on the rack-\nscale stuff is on MI400.\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein\nResearch.\n\n\nStacy Aaron Rasgon\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\n\nFor the first one, given the China Data Center GPU headwinds in Q2 and Q3,\ndo you think that GPU business actually grows year-over-year in Q2 and Q3,\nunderstanding your comments for the full year on it? But do you think given\nthose headwinds in Q2 and Q3, it can actually grow year-over-year?\n\n\nLisa T. Su\nChair, President & CEO\n\nI think your -- let's see. Stacy, the best way to answer that question is,\nin Q2, it's not going to grow year-over-year just given what we've said\nabout the $700 million coming out of Q2 and how we had previously talked\nabout the evolution. But we do believe that we'll grow year-over-year going\nforward, in Q3 and Q4 certainly, for us to do the full year with strong\ndouble-digit growth.\n\n\nStacy Aaron Rasgon\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\n\nOkay. So you do think it can grow year-over-year in Q3? Okay. For my second\nquestion, I wanted to ask about kind of the trends in Q1. So you said Data\nCenter GPU was down, I guess, modestly in Q1, as expected. But again, if I\ngo back to your sort of double-digit year-over-year comments, I mean, it\ncouldn't have been any more than like $1.4 billion in Q1 for DC GPU, and it\nfeels like it's less than that, which means it would have been down at\nleast 20% sequentially, maybe more, which also implies that the server CPUs\nin Q1 were up sequentially, which was also well above seasonal, similar to\nClient. I guess what I'm asking is, are those trends correct? Am I modeling\nthat correct? And I guess, what are the implications in that case of server\nCPUs actually up well above seasonal in Q1 given this environment?\n\n\nJean X. Hu\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nNo, I think -- Stacy, this is Jean. I think when you think about the Q1\nData Center performance, it's declined 5% so it's a little bit better from\na server perspective because it has declined sequentially. Same thing like\nData Center GPU, like Lisa mentioned earlier, it did decline. So I think\nthat is the overall Data Center performance. I think -- I don't know about\nyour model, but that is how we really look at the numbers, how we think\nabout it.\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche\nBank.\n\n\nRoss Clark Seymore\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\n\nI'm going to go to the Embedded space. I know it's not the biggest one, but\neverything else has been addressed pretty detailed. You mentioned the\nsecond half getting up to year-over-year growth. It seems like that\nrequires some significant double-digit growth sequentially in both quarters\njust to get the full half there. What gives you the confidence in that sort\nof ramp?\n\n\nJean X. Hu\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nYes. Ross, thank you for the question. On the Embedded side, we started to\nsee a gradual recovery. I think there are signs, especially the order\npattern, the book-to-bill ratios, we see improving. In like aerospace,\ndefense and also test management side, we see a very visible improvement.\nIn industrial side, the improvement is less so, their inventory still among\ndifferent customers. But overall, the trend, the demand pattern does\nimprove. I think Q2, we did guide sequentially flattish. And I think we'll\nstart to see Q3, especially Q4, you will see a year-over-year increase,\nespecially in Q4.\n\n\nRoss Clark Seymore\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\n\nAnd I guess my last question would be on the OpEx side of things. You\nguided to the number for the second quarter, $2.3 billion. You said there's\n$50 million from ZT in there. Is that the entirety of the ZT side of\nthings? Or what should we think for kind of full year OpEx or the second\nhalf, however you want to discuss it?\n\n\nJean X. Hu\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nYes, Ross, thank you for the question. For the ZT design team, we view it\nas quarterly, the incremental OpEx is about $50 million. That $2.3 billion\ninclude everything from ZT because we closed the transaction on March 31. I\nthink when you look at the overall, our OpEx increase year-over-year, we\ncontinue to drive revenue growth to increase more than OpEx. Looking at Q2,\nat the middle point of our guidance, revenue will be increasing 27%, and we\ndo expect the earnings per share growing much faster than the top line\nrevenue growth. So OpEx side, we'll be very disciplined to continue to\nmanage it.\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the final question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan\nStanley.\n\n\nJoseph Lawrence Moore\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\n\nOne of the things your cloud customers have been talking about is this kind\nof growth in inference costs, the sort of reasoning models using a lot of\ninference compute and some tightness. Can you talk about that from AMD's\nperspective? Are you seeing that in your business? Does that change the\nfocus that you have going forward?\n\n\nLisa T. Su\nChair, President & CEO\n\nSure, Joe. So I think overall, what we're seeing is that with these new\nreasoning models, the inferencing is more important. And there's also a\nmove to more distributed inferencing. So I think that plays into our\nstrengths. I think we have demonstrated with MI300 that we are an excellent\ninference solution, and that holds true for 325 and 350 Series as well. So\nwe continue to see with our memory bandwidth and memory capacity\nadvantages, that's a positive.\n\n\nI will say that as we're going into this, the number of workloads that\nwe're seeing overall is expanding. So we're seeing both training and\ninferencing as important workloads that we're working on and our customers\ncontinue to demonstrate. I think the desire that we're seeing probably from\na trend standpoint is that there are many models that people are using\ntoday. So they're not necessarily using 1 model. They're actually using\nseveral different models and the optimizations around that are the things\nthat we're doing with our ROCm software suite.\n\n\nJoseph Lawrence Moore\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\n\nGreat. And then just an update on your thoughts on competing with custom\nsilicon with ASICs in the AI space. Most of your largest customers also\nhave a custom silicon offering. So will they invest in both AMD and ASICs?\nAnd just how do they decide how to apportion that investment?\n\n\nLisa T. Su\nChair, President & CEO\n\nYes. I mean, Joe, I view them as really two different things. I think one\nof the primary aspects as we've talked about the $500 billion TAM and the\nopportunities there, look, we think ASICs have a place. We happen to think\nGPUs have a larger piece of that because the models are changing so much.\nAnd from our standpoint, it's really important to have competitive TCO. And\npeople want choice to get there, especially as inference costs become so\nimportant, and we're working on trying to expand the overall inferencing\nsort of capability out there. So I don't think it's an either/or. I think\nit's, \"Let's get the best solutions out there,\" and we will certainly\nbelieve that we're very competitive in inferencing. And I think we are also\nbecoming a much more sort of solution for training as well.\n\n\nOperatorAnd ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the question-and-\nanswer session, and that also concludes today's teleconference.

  "presentation_text": "Operator\n\nGreetings, and welcome to the AMD First Quarter 2025 Conference Call.\n[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being\nrecorded.\n\n\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce to you Matt Ramsay, Vice President,\nFinancial Strategy and Investor Relations.\n\n\nMatthew D. Ramsay\nVice President of Financial Strategy & Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and welcome to AMD's 2025 First Quarter Financial Results\nConference Call. By now, you should have had the opportunity to review a\ncopy of our earnings press release and the accompanying slides. If you have\nnot had the chance to review these materials, they can be found on the\nInvestor Relations portion of amd.com.\n\n\nWe will refer primarily to non-GAAP financial measures during today's call.\nThe full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations are available in today's press\nrelease and the slides posted on our website.\n\n\nParticipants on today's conference call are Dr. Lisa Su, our Chair and\nChief Executive Officer; and Jean Hu, Executive Vice President, Chief\nFinancial Officer and Treasurer. This is a live call and will be replayed\nvia webcast on our website.\n\n\nBefore we begin, I would like to take note that Mark Papermaster, our\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, will attend the TD\nCowen TMT Conference on Wednesday, May 28. And Jean Hu will attend the Bank\nof America Global Technology Conference on Tuesday, June 3.\n\n\nToday's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on our current\nbeliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only of today, and as such,\ninvolve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ\nmaterially from our current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary\nstatement on our press release for more information on factors that could\ncause actual results to differ materially. You will also find a detailed\ndiscussion of our risk factors in our filings with the SEC, in particular,\nAMD's most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q and annual report on Form\n10-K.\n\n\nAnd with that, I would like to hand the call over to Lisa.\n\n\nLisa T. Su\nChair, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Matt, and good afternoon to all those listening today.\n\n\nWe delivered an outstanding start to the year despite the evolving dynamics\nrelated to tariffs and the regulatory environment. Growth accelerated for\nthe fourth consecutive quarter year-over-year driven by strength in our\ncore businesses and expanding data center and AI momentum.\n\n\nRevenue and EPS both exceeded consensus estimates as Instinct AI\naccelerator, EPYC and Ryzen CPU sales grew significantly year-over-year. As\na result, first quarter revenue increased 36% year-over-year to $7.4\nbillion as our Data Center and Client & Gaming segments both grew by a\nlarge double-digit percentage.\n\n\nWe expanded gross margin year-over-year for the fifth straight quarter and\nincreased net income by 55% driven by a higher overall percentage of Data\nCenter product sales and a richer Ryzen processor mix.\n\n\nDespite the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, our first quarter performance\nhighlights the strength of our differentiated product portfolio and\nexecution and positions us well for strong growth in 2025.\n\n\nTurning to the segments. Data Center segment revenue increased 57% year-\nover-year to $3.7 billion. We gained server CPU share driven by the ramp of\nour latest fifth-gen EPYC Turin processors and sustained demand for 4th Gen\nEPYC. Hyperscaler demand remains strong as cloud providers expanded EPYC\ndeployments to power their critical infrastructure and public services.\nMore than 30 new instances launched from Alibaba, AWS, Google, Oracle,\nTencent, and others in the quarter, including the initial wave of 5th Gen\nEPYC Turin instances.\n\n\nIn addition, AWS launched new FPGA accelerated instances in the quarter,\npowered by EPYC processors with Xilinx Virtex FPGAs that are optimized for\ndata and compute-intensive workloads like genomics, multimedia processing,\nnetwork security and cloud-based video broadcasting. Every major cloud\nprovider is deep in development on Turin programs with a steady stream of\npublic instances and internal deployments expected to ramp into production\nover the coming quarters.\n\n\nEnterprise adoption of EPYC instances was very strong in the quarter. The\nnumber of EPYC-powered cloud instances activated by Forbes 2000 enterprise\ncustomers more than doubled year-over-year, including new wins with\nInternet native streaming, transportation, financial services, and social\nmedia companies. For example, CrowdStrike achieved major performance in\ncost improvements by broadly deploying EPYC instances across its multi-\ncloud infrastructure.\n\n\nAt the same time, we're also actively partnering with leading application\nand cloud providers to deploy EPYC-optimized solutions tailored for\nspecialized industry verticals. Siemens launched their latest software-\ndefined vehicle solution powered by EPYC CPUs and Radeon Pro GPUs on Azure,\nleveraging digital twin technology to significantly speed up automotive\ndesign and validation.\n\n\nOracle launched a new version of its Exadata database platform, which is\nused by more than half of the Fortune Global 100. The latest Exadata X11M\nhas been optimized for 5th Gen EPYC processors to deliver up to 25% faster\nperformance in transaction processing and analytics compared to the prior\ngeneration.\n\n\nTurning to enterprise on-prem adoption. EPYC CPU sales grew by a large\ndouble-digit percentage year-over-year for the seventh straight quarter\ndriven by new public sector wins and high-volume deployments with large\nautomotive, semiconductor, financial services, retail, energy, and\ntechnology companies.\n\n\nWe have built significant enterprise momentum over the last few years as\nour partners expanded the number of EPYC-based platforms to more than 450\nand we scaled our joint go-to-market programs. As a result, EPYC is now\ndeployed by all of the top 10 telecom, aerospace, and semiconductor\ncompanies, 9 out of the top 10 automotive, 7 out of the top 10\nmanufacturing, and 6 out of the top 10 energy companies on the Forbes 2000.\nWe expect enterprise adoption to accelerate over the coming quarters as\nmore than 150 Turin platforms become broadly available from Dell, Cisco,\nHPE, Lenovo, Super Micro and others.\n\n\nLooking forward, we see a clear path to continued share gains as customers\nramp their 5th Gen EPYC offerings that deliver unmatched performance,\nefficiency and TCO across every major cloud and enterprise data center\nworkload. We passed key milestones in April to begin manufacturing 5th Gen\nEPYC at TSMC's new Arizona fab, with first production shipments expected in\nthe second half of 2025. Longer term, we announced our next-gen EPYC Venice\nprocessors, our lead HPC products for TSMC's 2-nanometer process node.\nVenice silicon is in our labs and performing well with bring-up and\nvalidation progressing to support a 2026 launch.\n\n\nTurning to our Data Center AI business. Revenue increased by a significant\ndouble-digit percentage year-over-year as MI325X shipments ramped to\nsupport new enterprise and cloud deployments. More than 35 MI300 Series\nplatforms are in production from all the leading service providers,\nsupporting the expanding number of Instinct GPU deployments with cloud,\nenterprise and AI customers. Several hyperscalers expanded their use of\nInstinct accelerators to cover an increasing range of generative AI search,\nranking and recommendation use cases. We also added multiple Tier 1 cloud\nand enterprise customers in the quarter, including one of the largest\nfrontier model developers that is now using Instinct GPUs to serve a\nsignificant portion of their daily inference traffic.\n\n\nThe depth and breadth of our customer engagements continues to expand as\nbreakthroughs in large-scale AI models like OpenAI's o3 and DeepSeek's R1\ndrive increased demand for traditional inferencing and increasingly, as a\ncritical part of pretraining. The industry-leading memory capacity and\nbandwidth of our Instinct portfolio is ideally suited for these workloads,\nand we are actively working with multiple customers to scale Instinct from\nsingle-node deployments to distributed inferencing clusters.\n\n\nTraining engagements also ramped in the quarter as multiple Tier 1\nhyperscale, AI and enterprise customers scaled Instinct GPU clusters to\ntrain internal and frontier models. In parallel, we're making meaningful\nprogress with sovereign AI deployments as countries expand investments to\nestablish domestic nation-scale AI infrastructure. In February, we\nannounced a strategic partnership with G42 to build one of France's most\npowerful AI compute facilities powered by Instinct accelerators.\n\n\nOn the AI software front, we significantly accelerated our release cadence\nin the first quarter, shifting from quarterly ROCm updates to delivering\nready to deploy training and inferencing containers on a biweekly basis\nthat include performance optimizations and support for the latest\nlibraries, kernels and algorithms. We expanded our open source community\nenablement in the quarter, making significantly more Instinct compute\ninfrastructure available to enable developers to automatically build, test,\nand deploy updates to ROCm code nightly. As a result, more than 2 million\nmodels on Hugging Face now run out of the box on AMD.\n\n\nWe're also enabling an increasing number of models to launch with Day Zero\nsupport for Instinct accelerators, including Meta's Llama 4, Google's Gemma\n3, and DeepSeek's R1 models that were released in the first quarter.\n\n\nBeyond launch, we are delivering regular software updates that increase\nperformance for new models. For example, in the weeks following the launch\nof DeepSeek's R1 model, we introduced ROCm optimizations that enabled MI300\nto deliver leadership inferencing throughput. We released ROCm 6.4 in the\nquarter with major upgrades that increased training and inferencing\nperformance across popular AI frameworks like PyTorch, JAX and vLLM. The\nrelease also adds multiple ease-of-use features, including new cluster\nmanagement tools that simplify the scaling and optimization of large-scale\nInstinct deployments.\n\n\nTurning to our AI solutions capabilities. Earlier this quarter, we\ncompleted our acquisition of ZT Systems, adding world-class systems design\nexpertise to complement our silicon and software leadership. With ZT, we\ncan provide ready-to-deploy rack-level AI solutions based on industry\nstandards built with AMD CPUs, GPUs and networking, reducing deployment\ntime for hyperscalers and accelerating time to market for OEM and ODM\npartners. The team is fully engaged and already co-designing with key\ncustomers and rack-level designs optimized for our upcoming MI400 series\nand working with customers and OEM partners to accelerate time to market\nfor our MI350 series. We have received significant interest in ZT's\nmanufacturing business and expect to announce a strategic partner shortly.\n\n\nWe began sampling our next-gen MI350 series with multiple customers in the\nfirst quarter and remain on track to begin accelerated production by\nmidyear. MI350 Series performance is very strong based on the advances in\nour CDNA 4 architecture. We designed CDNA 4 to deliver leadership\nperformance across a wide range of AI workloads, increasing memory capacity\nand bandwidth 1.5x, adding support for new data types and improving network\nefficiency to deliver 35x higher throughput and performance compared to\nMI300x. Customer interest in the MI350 Series is very strong, setting the\nstage for broad deployment in the second half of this year. As one example,\nwe are partnering with Oracle to deploy a large-scale cluster powered by\nMI355x accelerators, 5th Gen EPYC Turin processors and Pollara 400 AI NICs.\nThis multibillion-dollar initiative highlights the expanding AMD and OCI\npartnership and the growing demand for AMD Instinct to power the next wave\nof large-scale AI infrastructure.\n\n\nLooking ahead, our MI400 Series development remains on track to launch next\nyear. The MI400 Series is designed to deliver leadership performance for\nboth inferencing and training, scaling seamlessly from single servers to\nfull data center deployments. Early customer feedback has been very\npositive, marking a major step forward in our Instinct road map and\nsignificantly expanding our AI accelerator TAM as customers plan broader\nInstinct deployments to power a larger share of their AI infrastructure.\n\n\nI'm looking forward to sharing more details on the MI350 Series, future\nMI400 rack-scale solutions and the growing customer adoption of our\nInstinct platforms at our Advancing AI event on June 12.\n\n\nTurning to our Client & Gaming segment. Segment revenue increased 28% year-\nover-year to $2.9 billion. Client revenue grew 68% year-over-year, marking\nour fifth consecutive quarter of revenue share gains. We delivered record\nclient CPU ASP driven by a richer mix of high-end desktop and mobile Ryzen\nprocessors. Desktop channel sell-out increased by more than 50% year-over-\nyear. We set new sell-out records in multiple regions as our latest-\ngeneration Ryzen processors became the CPU of choice for gamers, topping\nbestseller lists at leading global e-tailers. To build on this momentum, we\nextended our desktop CPU portfolio with the launch of our 16-core Ryzen\n9950X 3D processor that delivers significantly higher gaming and\nproductivity performance than the competition.\n\n\nIn mobile, AMD-based notebook sell-through was very strong in the quarter.\nWe also saw strong demand for our latest generation AI PC processors as\nsales ramped, increasing by more than 50% quarter-on-quarter. The first\nnotebooks powered by our new high-end Ryzen AI MAX+ and the first\nmainstream Ryzen AI 7 and 5 300 Series processors launched to very positive\nreviews. These new processors set the standard for traditional computing\nand graphics performance while also delivering unmatched AI capabilities in\nbattery life, positioning Ryzen as a CPU of choice for gaming, ultrathin\nand commercial notebooks.\n\n\nDemand for AMD-based commercial PCs was also very strong in the quarter.\nRyzen PRO PC sell-through grew more than 30% year-over-year driven by new\nend customer wins and an 80% increase from 2024 in the number of AMD-\npowered commercial systems from HP, Lenovo, Dell and Asus. We closed\nmultiple wins with large auto, energy, health care, financial services and\ntelecom companies in the quarter. Looking more broadly across the PC\nmarket, we remain confident we can grow client processor revenue well ahead\nof the market in 2025 led by expanding adoption of our desktop channel and\nconsumer and commercial notebook portfolio as well as a richer mix.\n\n\nTurning to our Gaming business results. Gaming revenue decreased 30% year-\nover-year as higher Radeon graphics sales were more than offset by low semi-\ncustom sales. While our semi-custom SoC sales declined year-over-year,\nconsole channel inventories have normalized as demand sales have\nstrengthened for 2025. For PC gaming, we launched our Radeon 9070 series to\nstrong demand as our new RDNA 4 architecture delivers leadership\nperformance for mainstream gamers. First week sell-out set a record and was\nmore than 10x higher than our previous best Radeon launch. Demand remains\nvery strong, and we are working closely with our board partners to\nreplenish inventory weekly and need to sustain demand.\n\n\nWe also introduced FSR 4, our first machine learning-based rendering\ntechnology that delivers significantly higher frame rates and more\nimmersive gaming experiences. FSR 4 is already enabled in over 30 games\nwith support expected to reach 75 titles by year-end.\n\n\nTurning to our Embedded segment. First quarter revenue decreased 3% year-\nover-year to $823 million. Embedded demand continues to recover gradually.\nWe expect improving demand in the test and measurement, communications and\naerospace markets will drive a return to growth in the second half of 2025.\nWe completed initial shipments of our cost-optimized Spartan UltraScale+\nFPGAs and second-generation Versal AI Edge SoCs to meet growing demand for\nAI at the Edge.\n\n\nAs a part of continuing to grow our Embedded x86 business, we launched our\nEPYC Embedded 9005 Series CPUs that deliver leadership performance for\nnetworking, storage and industrial edge applications. Cisco selected our\nnew EPYC Embedded processors for their latest high-end firewall solutions,\nand IBM is using them to power its latest storage-scale System 6000 for\nperformance-intensive enterprise analytics and AI workloads. We also\nreleased our latest Vitis AI software suite, expanding support for the\nlatest models and accelerating Edge AI deployment across a broader range of\napplications, further strengthening our leadership in the rapidly emerging\nEdge AI market.\n\n\nIn summary, our strong first quarter results and second quarter outlook\nreflect the momentum we are building across our business. While we face\nsome headwinds from the dynamic macro and regulatory environments,\nincluding the recently announced export controls for Instinct MI308X\nshipments to China, we believe they are more than offset by the powerful\ntailwinds from our leadership product portfolio. Against this backdrop, we\nremain confident we can deliver strong double-digit percentage revenue\ngrowth in 2025 based on accelerating share gains with our latest generation\nof Zen 5 EPYC and Ryzen CPUs and Radeon GPUs and ramping production of our\nInstinct MI350 Series accelerators in the second half of the year to\nsupport an expanded set of customers and AI workloads.\n\n\nWe also expect full year growth in our semi-custom business, and for our\nEmbedded business to return to year-over-year growth, in the second half of\nthe year driven by the reduced inventory levels and improving demand\nenvironment.\n\n\nTo capitalize on our unprecedented growth opportunities and deliver our\nnext major growth arc, we are expanding investments in our product and\ntechnology road maps, go-to-market initiatives and full stack AI software\nand data center scale solutions capabilities. We're also doubling down our\nexecution to deliver and, where possible, accelerate our industry-leading\nroad maps.\n\n\nWe view the current environment as a strategic opportunity to further\ndifferentiate AMD as we deliver an expanding product portfolio that combine\nleadership compute and AI capabilities for data centers, edge, PCs and\nembedded end devices.\n\n\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color\non our first quarter results. Jean?\n\n\nJean X. Hu\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of\nour financial results and then provide our current outlook for the second\nquarter of fiscal 2025. As a reminder, for comparative purposes, our first\nquarter fiscal year 2025 financial statement disclosures include the\ncombination of our Client & Gaming businesses into a single reportable\nsegment to align with how we manage the business. We continue to provide\ndistinct revenue disclosures for our Data Center, Client & Gaming and\nEmbedded businesses.\n\n\nWe are pleased with our record first quarter revenue of $7.4 billion,\nexceeding the high end of our guidance, up 36% year-over-year, driven by\n57% revenue growth in the Data Center segment and a 28% revenue growth in\nthe Client & Gaming segment. Revenue declined 3% sequentially due to lower\nrevenue in the Embedded and Data Center segments, partially offset by\nsequential growth in the Client & Gaming segment. Gross margin was 54%, up\n140 basis points from a year ago.\n\n\nOperating expenses were $2.2 billion, an increase of 28% year-over-year as\nwe continue to invest aggressively in go-to-market activities and in R&D to\naddress the significant growth opportunity ahead of us. Operating income\nwas $1.8 billion, representing a 24% operating margin. Taxes, interest\nexpenses and the other was $213 million.\n\n\nFor the first quarter of 2025, diluted earnings per share was $0.96, an\nincrease of 55% year-over-year.\n\n\nNow turning to our reportable segments, starting with the Data Center. Data\nCenter segment revenue was $3.7 billion, up 57% year-over-year, primarily\ndriven by continued CPU server share gains across both the cloud and\nenterprise customers and strong growth of AMD Instinct GPUs. On a\nsequential basis, Data Center segment revenue decreased 5%. Data Center\nsegment operating income was $932 million or 25% of revenue compared to\n$541 million or 23% a year ago.\n\n\nClient & Gaming segment revenue was $2.9 billion, up 28% year-over-year,\ndriven primarily by strong customer demand for our latest generation Zen 5\nAMD Ryzen processors, partially offset by lower semi-custom revenue. Client\nrevenue was $2.3 billion, up 68% year-over-year. More than half of the\ngrowth was driven by higher ASPs from a richer mix of high-end Ryzen\nprocessors. On a sequential basis, Client & Gaming segment revenue\nincreased by 2%, primarily driven by stronger-than-seasonal performance of\nour Client product portfolio and increased semi-custom product revenue.\nClient & Gaming segment operating income was $496 million or 17% of revenue\ncompared to $237 million or 10% a year ago driven by operating leverage on\nhigher revenue.\n\n\nEmbedded segment revenue was $823 million, down 3% year-over-year. Embedded\ndemand continues to recover gradually. Sequentially, Embedded was down 11%,\nconsistent with our expectations. Embedded segment operating income was\n$328 million or 40% of revenue compared to $342 million or 41% a year ago.\n\n\nTurning to the balance sheet and the cash flow. During the quarter, we\ngenerated $939 million in cash from operations, and our free cash flow for\nthe quarter was $727 million. We returned $749 million to shareholders\nthrough the repurchase of common stock in our repurchase program. We have\n$4 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization.\n\n\nAt the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents and short-term\ninvestments was $7.3 billion. Within the quarter, we reached $1.5 billion\nof debt and issued $950 million of commercial paper to help fund our\nacquisition of ZT Systems, which was completed on March 31.\n\n\nNow turning to our second quarter 2025 outlook. As a reminder, in April, a\nnew export license requirement was put in place for MI308 shipments to\nChina, the impact of which is included in our guidance. We expect revenue\nto be approximately $7.4 billion plus or minus $300 million. This includes\nan estimated $700 million revenue reduction as a result of the new export\nlicense requirement. Despite this headwind, the midpoint of our guidance\nrepresents 27% year-over-year revenue growth.\n\n\nFor the full year 2025, we estimate the revenue impact due to the export\nlicense requirement to be approximately $1.5 billion. Sequentially, we\nexpect Client & Gaming segment revenue to increase by double-digit\npercentage, Embedded segment revenue to be flattish, and we expect Data\nCenter segment revenue to decrease due to the exclusion of MI308 revenue.\n\n\nIn addition, we expect second quarter non-GAAP gross margin is estimated to\nbe 43%, inclusive of approximately $800 million in charges for inventory\nand related reserves. Excluding this charge, our non-GAAP gross margin\nwould be approximately 54%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately\n$2.3 billion, which includes approximately $50 million in OpEx due to the\naddition of the ZT Systems design team. The financials for the ZT\nmanufacturing business will be reported as discontinued operations starting\nin the second quarter.\n\n\nWe expect net interest and other expenses to be $5 million due to the debt\nassociated with the ZT System transaction; non-GAAP effective tax rate to\nbe 13% and the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.64\nbillion shares, which includes 9 million shares related to the ZT\ntransaction.\n\n\nLooking forward, despite ongoing macro and trade policy-related\nuncertainties, we believe the investments we are making will position us\nwell to address the large growth opportunities ahead as AI expand the use\nof high-performance computing across all our end markets.\n\n\nIn closing, 2025 is off to a strong start as we continue to execute on key\nstrategic and financial goals. We delivered strong top line revenue growth,\nexpanded gross and operating margins and closed the key acquisition of ZT\nSystems to expand and accelerate our Data Center GPU and the systems road\nmaps.\n\n\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Matt for the Q&A session.\n\n\nMatthew D. Ramsay\nVice President of Financial Strategy & Investor RelationsThank you very\nmuch, Jean. John, can you go ahead and pool the callers for the Q&A\nsession, please?",
  "qa_text": "Operator\n\n[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of\nJoshua Buchalter with TD Cowen.\n\n\nJoshua Louis Buchalter\nTD Cowen, Research Division\n\nCongrats on the results. I was hoping you can maybe expand on the drivers\nof upside in both the print and in particular, the guide. How should we\nthink about 2Q growth by segment? And wanted to double-click on Client in\nparticular. That business is up 67% year-over-year in the first quarter,\nand there's obviously a lot of concerns on pull-in. So I was hoping you\ncould walk through some of the drivers of the strength in Client in\nparticular and how you're thinking about that in 2Q.\n\n\nLisa T. Su\nChair, President & CEO\n\nOkay. Great, Josh. Thanks for the question. Look, we were very pleased with\nour performance in Q1. We actually saw strength across a number of our\nbusinesses. We saw strength certainly in the Client business, very strong\ndesktop performance. We saw strength in our gaming business as well, which\nwas really due to our strong Radeon launch. And we also saw some strength\nin our Data Center business across both stronger CPU and GPU. So those are\nsome of the drivers for our Q1 performance.\n\n\nAnd in particular, on your question of Client performance, we've certainly\nlooked very carefully at the ordering patterns and what customers are\ntelling us. We have not seen a lot of tariff-related activity in that\nbusiness. I would say, though, what we have seen is a real stronger mix and\nstrength in our overall ASPs. So the desktop channel, which is an area\nwhere we have a very strong gaming products right now, actually performed\nwell above seasonality in Q1, and that is really the strength of the ASPs\nthere. So that's what we saw in Q1.\n\n\nAnd then to your question about the guide for Q2, as Jean mentioned, we do\nhave the new export control limitation on MI308. So we have taken out that\nrevenue, which is a $700 million headwind in Q2. But with that, we have a\nstrong outlook given the strength across the rest of our businesses. So we\ncontinue to see strength in Client going into the second quarter. Again,\nthe desktop business continues to perform above typical seasonality. We're\nalso seeing the beginning of the commercial ramp, which is a place where we\nhave traditionally been quite underrepresented.\n\n\nWe see continued strength in Gaming, I would say, much better than typical\nseasonality. That is really our AIB business, with the Radeon products\nramping. As well as consoles have now drained all of their inventory, and\nso they are starting their ramp into the year. And from a Data Center side,\nwe see sequential growth on the CPU side. We see the GPU right on track\nminus the China export controls. And so for all of those reasons, we're\npleased with where the performance of the business is right now.\n\n\nJean X. Hu\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nYes. I'll just add 1 point to what Lisa just said on the Client business.\nWe had really strong performance in Q1. Sequentially, Client revenue is\nlargely flattish versus Q4. When you look behind it, our units actually\ndeclined double digit. So the revenue flattish is largely driven by the ASP\nincrease sequentially due to the richer mix Lisa just mentioned.\n\n\nJoshua Louis Buchalter\nTD Cowen, Research Division\n\nTo follow up, I wanted to ask about how the ex China, X308 (sic) [ 308X ]\nInstinct family performed in the quarter and how you're thinking about the\nback half of the year. I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks\nsignificant double-digit year-over-year. Could you maybe provide some color\non how Instinct did in the first quarter, how you're thinking about the\nfirst half ahead of the 350 ramp next month?\n\n\nLisa T. Su\nChair, President & CEO\n\nSure. So on the Instinct ramp, I would say Q1 performance of Data Center\nGPU was in line with maybe a little bit better than expected. I think the\nkey point that we've always said about the Instinct ramp is very excited\nabout the MI350 launch. We're right on track for that launching midyear. I\nwould say customer interest has been very high. So from a competitiveness\nstandpoint, we feel really good about where it's positioned. Overall, I\nthink one of the advantages that we have with the MI350 launch is that,\nfrom a systems overall environment, it's actually very similar to the\nMI300. So we believe it's going to ramp fast. And we already have a couple\nof deals that have been announced, including a very important relationship\nwith Oracle in terms of the MI350 series for a number of joint customers.\n\n\nSo we're excited about the overall AI business. I think we continue to see\nstrength there. I know there are some uncertainties as it relates to\ntariffs and other things. But this is one of those areas where, from an\ninfrastructure standpoint, there continues to be investment in AI\ninfrastructure. And so with that, we would expect strong growth into the\nsecond half of the year.\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\n\n\nTimothy Michael Arcuri\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\n\nLisa, you said that Data Center GPU grew significant double digit, but it\nwas like $600 million last March. So I would think that -- I mean, I think\na lot of us thought it was going to be like $1.7 billion to $1.75 billion.\nIs that the wrong way to sort of interpret that because it seems like it\nmore than -- it went up triple digits at least? So can you help us there?\nAnd also, I'm curious, the additional $100 million that sort of has to come\nout from the ban, does that all come out in September? Or is there some\nremnants to have to come out in the fourth quarter as well?\n\n\nLisa T. Su\nChair, President & CEO\n\nYes. So again, what I would say is the Data Center GPU business did perform\nvery well in the first quarter. I think we have to go back and look at what\nyou had for first quarter 2024. But overall standpoint, it performed right\nwhere we would expect. Relative to your conversation as to where does it\ncome out, I would say the vast majority already comes out in the September\nquarter. So think about -- Jean mentioned $1.5 billion. You would see the\nmajority of it in Q2 and Q3 with very little in Q4. So we had always\nexpected that the fourth quarter, because it would be very focused on the\nMI350 family, would be non-China revenue, and that's how it was planned.\n\n\nTimothy Michael Arcuri\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\n\nGot it. And then, Jean, just on the inventory, it was up a lot. Is that\njust due to ZT? Or is there something else happening there?\n\n\nJean X. Hu\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nWell, on the inventory side, we built some inventory primarily to support\nvery strong client and server ramp and also the second half Data Center GPU\nramp. As you probably know, the lead time is really long to build. For the\nQ3, Q4 ramp, we really need to start the wafers right now. That's why the\ninventory has increased.\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\n\n\nHarlan L.  Sur\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nI know there's been a lot of focus in your upcoming MI350 Series, Lisa, but\nMI400 next year is where you potentially close the competitive gap in a big\nway, right? You're bringing frontier class model training performance GPU\nin a rack-scale solution. More and more, the challenges has been standing\nup these rack-scale platforms, power, cooling, footprint, networking,\nconnectivity, telemetry, et cetera, right, lots of well-telegraphed issues\nwith standing up these rack-scale architectures. So as you've shared your\nMI400 rack-scale solution architecture with customers, like what is the AMD\nteam doing to potentially address the ease of these deployments with the\nMI400? And just in general, what's the overall feedback been like on MI400?\n\n\n\nLisa T. Su\nChair, President & CEO\n\nYes, Harlan, thank you for the question. I think, look, we're excited about\nthe MI350 Series launch that's coming up, but we are extremely excited as\nwell about the MI400 Series and the road map there. I think we've been very\nactive with customers on our road map. As you know, this is one of those\nareas where you absolutely have to be planning many quarters in advance for\nthat. One of the primary reasons we acquired ZT Systems was exactly to\naddress this rack-scale architecture. And so from that standpoint, the\nclosing of the ZT acquisition has been very timely. What we're doing right\nnow is, together with our ZT design team as well as our customers' design\nteams and our own systems design capability, really actively planning what\nthose rack-scale systems are going to look like.\n\n\nI would say the MI400 Series enthusiasm from customers is high. And there's\na lot of activities that are going on right now to ensure that we do, in\nfact, learn from some of the, let's call it, some of the challenges that\nhave occurred with some of the recent deployments.\n\n\nHarlan L.  Sur\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nAnd then I continue to be impressed, I mean, 7 consecutive quarters of\nstrong year-over-year growth in your EPYC enterprise and on-prem traction,\nright? You have high-30s, low-40s type share of the overall server market\nin enterprise and on-prem. Your share is probably in the sort of low-20%\nrange but significant share momentum. Can you just remind us like what has\nthe AMD team done? What have you put in place, sort of go-to-market wise,\nto drive the strong tailwind here in what has been a very, very tough\nmarket segment to crack?\n\n\nLisa T. Su\nChair, President & CEO\n\nI think there are a couple of things, Harlan. First of all, the strength of\nthe product cannot be undersold, right? At this moment, with 5th Gen EPYC,\nthe overall cloud adoption has been fantastic. And then on the enterprise\nside, we've really broadened the product portfolio for Turin that includes,\nlet's call it, low core count up through the highest core count and\nfrequency ranges. So that's very helpful.\n\n\nBut probably the largest impact has been in go-to-market. In the go-to-\nmarket space, we have added significant head count and capability to\naddress end users directly. And with the use cases, I think some of the\nthings that we talked about across industries, we're actually learning from\neach deployment and replicating that across many of the industrial\npartners. So overall, I think it's been a strong effort on enterprise. And\nwe're really still in the very early stages of that. I would say we're\nstill quite underrepresented in enterprise. But with the platform coverage\nand the processor coverage, I think we feel good about the opportunities.\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\n\n\n\nAaron Christopher Rakers\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\n\nGoing back to kind of the Data Center business and particularly the GPU\nbusiness, I think last quarter, you had alluded to the fact that you had\nexpected the Data Center revenue to be roughly flat in the first half of\nthe year. I guess if we were to take out the $700 million impact from\nChina, would the expectation still be flat for the year? Is that a fair\nassumption?\n\n\nJean X. Hu\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nAaron, so you're right. Last time, we did mention the first half Data\nCenter GPU, it's flattish versus second half. The way to think about it,\nwhat Lisa mentioned, is the $1.5 billion impact largely will be in Q2 and\nQ3. And so when you take out $700 million in Q2 and the majority in Q3,\nthat is what impacted in Q2 and Q3. But remember what Lisa mentioned is we\ndo see second half weighted, as we launch MI355, we will see significant\nramp. Year-over-year, we see strong double-digit growth of our Data Center\nbusiness and the GPU business also.\n\n\nAaron Christopher Rakers\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\n\nOkay. And then as a quick follow-up, kind of thinking about the gross\nmargin, obviously, this quarter's guidance is reflective of the charge that\nyou're taking. Should we assume that in the back half, with mix attributes\nto be considered, that you would see a return to that 54-plus percent gross\nmargin in the second half of the year. Is that a fair assessment?\n\n\nJean X. Hu\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nYes, Aaron, thank you for the question. Yes, there are a few puts and takes\non the gross margin. If you think about Q2, excluding $800 million charge\nrelated to MI308, our gross margin actually is around 54%. So at the\ncompany level, right, the mix is less favorable because the Client and the\nGaming business is growing sequentially, but we do have a few drivers to\ndrive the gross margin up. First, as I mentioned earlier, if you look at\nour Client business, the gross margin has been improving because the richer\nmix of our latest-generation product portfolio, that really helps. And also\nsecondly, within Data Center, when we expand the enterprise market share,\nwe do see gross margin improvement.\n\n\nOf course, in addition, MI308 Data Center GPU gross margin is on the low\nend for our Data Center GPU margin. So that also helps us overall, when we\nthink about the second half, we actually think the gross margin will\nimprove slightly because Data Center continues to be a very strong growth\ndriver, #1 growth driver, second half versus the first half, which will be\npartially offset by continued strength on the client and the gaming side.\nHope that answers your question.\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Thomas O'Malley with Barclays.\n\n\n\nThomas James O'Malley\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\n\nI just wanted to understand your view on system-based architectures and\nwhether you feel like you have what you need right now. Obviously, UALink\n1.0 is coming out. You can use third-party providers to kind of do the\ninterconnect. ZT Systems does do a lot for you in terms of the system\narchitecture. But from the interconnect side, do you think that you need\nmore? Is that something that you're going to do internally, look\nexternally? Just want to understand where you think the portfolio is today\nand whether you can address system-based architectures with what you have\ntoday.\n\n\nLisa T. Su\nChair, President & CEO\n\nTom, absolutely. I think we feel like we have all the pieces required as\nwell as deep partnerships in the ecosystem. And I consider it a system-\nlevel optimization between CPU, GPU networking capability, rack-scale\narchitecture. I think all of those pieces are things that we are investing\nin. And we're also partnering with others in the industry who are offering\nthese capabilities. I think when we look at the architectures that our\ncustomers want, our customers are really asking for one that we have a\nreference architecture that works but also that we work with them as they\nwant to interchange various pieces. Particularly on the networking side, I\nthink there are a couple of different solutions out there. And we are very\nmuch focused on ensuring that we interoperate across the spectrum.\n\n\nThomas James O'Malley\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\n\nHelpful. And then if we look at the full year, I mean, we'll get the units\nwith the filing, but it looks like there's some material share gains here\nin the first quarter. When you look at the full year, just to level set us\non share gains versus market growth, could you maybe talk about what you\nsee the Client business growing at a base level? And then just obviously,\nit's difficult to kind of predict where share will go. But just any\ncomments on what you're seeing thus far. Is a couple of points of shares\nkind of what you're seeing in the first quarter as well? We'll get a little\nmore later, but mostly just on the market growth for 2025.\n\n\nLisa T. Su\nChair, President & CEO\n\nSure, Tom. So if you're asking about share in the Client business, I think\nthat was the conversation, look, we are very pleased with our Client\nbusiness performance over the last couple of quarters. I think we are\nseeing unit growth, particularly in desktop, but where we're seeing\nprobably the most growth is overall revenue share. And so we're gaining\nshare in the right places, which is in sort of high-end notebook and\ncommercial as well as in desktop overall. So from that standpoint, that's\nwhere we think we're going.\n\n\nAs we go through the year, I know there's a good amount of conversation\nabout what happens in the macro and what happens with tariffs and does that\nchange things going forward. We are spending quite a bit of time ensuring\nthat we are aligning with our customers, looking at inventory levels,\nlooking at sort of consumption and overall sell-through. And we believe\nthat we have a good overall inventory position, and there is not, let's\ncall it, a tremendous amount of pull-ins or other things that are coming\ninto play. And we will continue to be very agile in how we look at that\ngoing forward.\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of\nAmerica Securities.\n\n\nVivek  Arya\nBofA Securities, Research Division\n\nI had 2 questions as well. On the first one, just near term, Lisa, your GPU\nsales grew sequentially in Q1? How much was MI308 in that number? And if\nyou look at 2025 overall, do you think GPUs can still grow despite this\nChina headwind that you've mentioned relative to the $5 billion-plus you\ndid last year?\n\n\nLisa T. Su\nChair, President & CEO\n\nYes, sure, Vivek. So let me answer the second question first. We absolutely\nbelieve the Data Center GPU will grow, and we think it will grow strong\ndouble digits. We had a plan that was second half weighted, and it still\nis. Relative to the MI308 situation, it's certainly a headwind, but one\nwhich we think is well contained given everything else that we have going\non. And relative to the Q1 performance of Data Center GPU, it was down very\nmodestly from Q4, which is what we expected. We did see good overall demand\nactually in the first quarter driven by MI325. So we had a significant\nadoption by a large foundational model company, which was very positive\nthere. And as we go forward, we expect that we will continue to broaden\nboth customers as well as workloads within our current customers for the\nInstinct portfolio.\n\n\nJean X. Hu\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nAnd Vivek, in Q1, MI325 and MI300 are a majority of our revenue.\n\n\nVivek  Arya\nBofA Securities, Research Division\n\nGreat. And then longer term, Lisa, in the past, you described, I believe,\nalmost a $500 billion or so addressable market for AI accelerators. How\nmuch of that roughly is China because that now seems to be somewhat\nrestricted for the U.S. companies? And then also kind of related to that,\nhow should we think about these AI diffusion rules that I think there is an\nimplementation date that is coming up on May 15. I'm curious what you have\nheard. So just sort of the implication of China restrictions and these AI\ndiffusion rules on thinking about the addressable opportunity for you\nlonger term.\n\n\nLisa T. Su\nChair, President & CEO\n\nYes, Vivek, I think it's a good question. I think overall, it is a very\ndynamic market, so you will appreciate that. On the China export controls,\nI think we always expected that there would be some amount of, let's call\nit, limitation on sort of leading-edge GPUs going into China. So that was\nfactored in to our TAM expectation when we talked about $500 billion. So I\ndon't think that dramatically changes the TAM.\n\n\nBut what I will say is, on the AI diffusion side, what we're very actively\nworking with the government, they're thinking through these rules, and it's\na very fine balance that we have to have. At the end of the day, when we\nlook at sort of the U.S. AI companies, we have leading-edge technology. We\nwant to ensure that the rest of the world can really use us as the primary\nplatform. So I think it will be important to work through the AI diffusion\nrules and all of that as we think about longer-term TAM. And we're\ncertainly spending quite a bit of efforts trying to ensure that it's well\nunderstood, the importance of the overall ecosystem and having the rest of\nthe world really adopt the U.S. ecosystem given our strength and leadership\noverall.\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor\nFitzgerald.\n\n\nChristopher James Muse\nCantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division\n\nI wanted to revisit your assumptions around Client. If you were to just\nflatline the Q1 actual, you would grow the business about 30%. You're\nobviously very bullish on taking share. You talked about huge tailwinds\nfrom ASPs. But curious, when you put it all together, how should we think\nabout traditional seasonality into the second half, particularly with the\npotential of some pull-ins here in the first half?\n\n\nLisa T. Su\nChair, President & CEO\n\nSure, C.J. It's a fair question. Look, we want to be very clear that our\nClient business performance is primarily driven by the strength of the\nproduct portfolio. And it's driven by some of the desktop channel products\nthat traditionally are not so well tracked if you look at sort of the IDCs\nof the world. We are planning for, let's call it, second half sub-seasonal\ngiven that we're off to such a strong start in the first half of the year.\nAnd that is what we're putting into our sort of internal planning number.\nSo you wouldn't see necessarily typical seasonality since the first half is\nbetter than seasonal.\n\n\nThat being the case, I think we feel strongly that, from a consumption\nbasis standpoint, we see the data. So when we look at the Q1 performance,\nit was a very, very strong Q1 in terms of sell-out and consumption for our\ndesktop business. And as we start Q2, we're now 4 weeks into it, we see\nthose patterns continuing. So we're in an upgrade cycle right now. Gaming\nCPUs are usually repurchased when there are gaming GPUs that come out in\nnew cycles. And I think we're benefiting from that on both the CPU and the\nGPU side, which is great. I mean, we're very happy with that, and we're\nramping up production to ensure that we keep the channel full.\n\n\nChristopher James Muse\nCantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division\n\nVery helpful. And then, I guess looking to next year, can you talk about\n400 Series and rack-level solution go-to-market strategy? You talked about\nkind of trying to obtain partners. Is there a certain number that you're\ntargeting? And then how are you thinking about kind of getting through some\nof the learning curve challenges of getting the rack-scale working with\nyour OEM partners such that you can deliver that ramp in 2026?\n\n\nLisa T. Su\nChair, President & CEO\n\nSure, C.J. So I think the right answer is we're getting a very early start,\nand that's what we have to do so that we maximize the overall learning\ncycle that is required for rack-scale solutions. We are working very\nclosely with a number of our hyperscale partners today to define those\nsolutions and make sure that we're thinking about all of the various areas\nthat could require work. And we're also working with our OEM partners who\nalso have, let's call it, learned quite a bit over the past couple of\nmonths and quarters as other rack-scale solutions have been coming online.\nSo I think we're doing everything to, let's call it, move ahead the\nlearning cycle. And again, we have the benefit of the MI350 Series being a\nrelatively, let's call it, not large lift. And so the focus on the rack-\nscale stuff is on MI400.\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein\nResearch.\n\n\nStacy Aaron Rasgon\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\n\nFor the first one, given the China Data Center GPU headwinds in Q2 and Q3,\ndo you think that GPU business actually grows year-over-year in Q2 and Q3,\nunderstanding your comments for the full year on it? But do you think given\nthose headwinds in Q2 and Q3, it can actually grow year-over-year?\n\n\nLisa T. Su\nChair, President & CEO\n\nI think your -- let's see. Stacy, the best way to answer that question is,\nin Q2, it's not going to grow year-over-year just given what we've said\nabout the $700 million coming out of Q2 and how we had previously talked\nabout the evolution. But we do believe that we'll grow year-over-year going\nforward, in Q3 and Q4 certainly, for us to do the full year with strong\ndouble-digit growth.\n\n\nStacy Aaron Rasgon\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\n\nOkay. So you do think it can grow year-over-year in Q3? Okay. For my second\nquestion, I wanted to ask about kind of the trends in Q1. So you said Data\nCenter GPU was down, I guess, modestly in Q1, as expected. But again, if I\ngo back to your sort of double-digit year-over-year comments, I mean, it\ncouldn't have been any more than like $1.4 billion in Q1 for DC GPU, and it\nfeels like it's less than that, which means it would have been down at\nleast 20% sequentially, maybe more, which also implies that the server CPUs\nin Q1 were up sequentially, which was also well above seasonal, similar to\nClient. I guess what I'm asking is, are those trends correct? Am I modeling\nthat correct? And I guess, what are the implications in that case of server\nCPUs actually up well above seasonal in Q1 given this environment?\n\n\nJean X. Hu\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nNo, I think -- Stacy, this is Jean. I think when you think about the Q1\nData Center performance, it's declined 5% so it's a little bit better from\na server perspective because it has declined sequentially. Same thing like\nData Center GPU, like Lisa mentioned earlier, it did decline. So I think\nthat is the overall Data Center performance. I think -- I don't know about\nyour model, but that is how we really look at the numbers, how we think\nabout it.\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche\nBank.\n\n\nRoss Clark Seymore\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\n\nI'm going to go to the Embedded space. I know it's not the biggest one, but\neverything else has been addressed pretty detailed. You mentioned the\nsecond half getting up to year-over-year growth. It seems like that\nrequires some significant double-digit growth sequentially in both quarters\njust to get the full half there. What gives you the confidence in that sort\nof ramp?\n\n\nJean X. Hu\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nYes. Ross, thank you for the question. On the Embedded side, we started to\nsee a gradual recovery. I think there are signs, especially the order\npattern, the book-to-bill ratios, we see improving. In like aerospace,\ndefense and also test management side, we see a very visible improvement.\nIn industrial side, the improvement is less so, their inventory still among\ndifferent customers. But overall, the trend, the demand pattern does\nimprove. I think Q2, we did guide sequentially flattish. And I think we'll\nstart to see Q3, especially Q4, you will see a year-over-year increase,\nespecially in Q4.\n\n\nRoss Clark Seymore\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\n\nAnd I guess my last question would be on the OpEx side of things. You\nguided to the number for the second quarter, $2.3 billion. You said there's\n$50 million from ZT in there. Is that the entirety of the ZT side of\nthings? Or what should we think for kind of full year OpEx or the second\nhalf, however you want to discuss it?\n\n\nJean X. Hu\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nYes, Ross, thank you for the question. For the ZT design team, we view it\nas quarterly, the incremental OpEx is about $50 million. That $2.3 billion\ninclude everything from ZT because we closed the transaction on March 31. I\nthink when you look at the overall, our OpEx increase year-over-year, we\ncontinue to drive revenue growth to increase more than OpEx. Looking at Q2,\nat the middle point of our guidance, revenue will be increasing 27%, and we\ndo expect the earnings per share growing much faster than the top line\nrevenue growth. So OpEx side, we'll be very disciplined to continue to\nmanage it.\n\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the final question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan\nStanley.\n\n\nJoseph Lawrence Moore\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\n\nOne of the things your cloud customers have been talking about is this kind\nof growth in inference costs, the sort of reasoning models using a lot of\ninference compute and some tightness. Can you talk about that from AMD's\nperspective? Are you seeing that in your business? Does that change the\nfocus that you have going forward?\n\n\nLisa T. Su\nChair, President & CEO\n\nSure, Joe. So I think overall, what we're seeing is that with these new\nreasoning models, the inferencing is more important. And there's also a\nmove to more distributed inferencing. So I think that plays into our\nstrengths. I think we have demonstrated with MI300 that we are an excellent\ninference solution, and that holds true for 325 and 350 Series as well. So\nwe continue to see with our memory bandwidth and memory capacity\nadvantages, that's a positive.\n\n\nI will say that as we're going into this, the number of workloads that\nwe're seeing overall is expanding. So we're seeing both training and\ninferencing as important workloads that we're working on and our customers\ncontinue to demonstrate. I think the desire that we're seeing probably from\na trend standpoint is that there are many models that people are using\ntoday. So they're not necessarily using 1 model. They're actually using\nseveral different models and the optimizations around that are the things\nthat we're doing with our ROCm software suite.\n\n\nJoseph Lawrence Moore\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\n\nGreat. And then just an update on your thoughts on competing with custom\nsilicon with ASICs in the AI space. Most of your largest customers also\nhave a custom silicon offering. So will they invest in both AMD and ASICs?\nAnd just how do they decide how to apportion that investment?\n\n\nLisa T. Su\nChair, President & CEO\n\nYes. I mean, Joe, I view them as really two different things. I think one\nof the primary aspects as we've talked about the $500 billion TAM and the\nopportunities there, look, we think ASICs have a place. We happen to think\nGPUs have a larger piece of that because the models are changing so much.\nAnd from our standpoint, it's really important to have competitive TCO. And\npeople want choice to get there, especially as inference costs become so\nimportant, and we're working on trying to expand the overall inferencing\nsort of capability out there. So I don't think it's an either/or. I think\nit's, \"Let's get the best solutions out there,\" and we will certainly\nbelieve that we're very competitive in inferencing. And I think we are also\nbecoming a much more sort of solution for training as well.\n\n\nOperatorAnd ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the question-and-\nanswer session, and that also concludes today's teleconference.

      "text": "Chair, President & CEO Thank you, Matt, and good afternoon to all those listening today. We delivered an outstanding start to the year despite the evolving dynamics related to tariffs and the regulatory environment. Growth accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter year-over-year driven by strength in our core businesses and expanding data center and AI momentum. Revenue and EPS both exceeded consensus estimates as Instinct AI accelerator, EPYC and Ryzen CPU sales grew significantly year-over-year. As a result, first quarter revenue increased 36% year-over-year to $7.4 billion as our Data Center and Client & Gaming segments both grew by a large double-digit percentage. We expanded gross margin year-over-year for the fifth straight quarter and increased net income by 55% driven by a higher overall percentage of Data Center product sales and a richer Ryzen processor mix. Despite the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, our first quarter performance highlights the strength of our differentiated product portfolio and execution and positions us well for strong growth in 2025. Turning to the segments. Data Center segment revenue increased 57% year- over-year to $3.7 billion. We gained server CPU share driven by the ramp of our latest fifth-gen EPYC Turin processors and sustained demand for 4th Gen EPYC. Hyperscaler demand remains strong as cloud providers expanded EPYC deployments to power their critical infrastructure and public services. More than 30 new instances launched from Alibaba, AWS, Google, Oracle, Tencent, and others in the quarter, including the initial wave of 5th Gen EPYC Turin instances. In addition, AWS launched new FPGA accelerated instances in the quarter, powered by EPYC processors with Xilinx Virtex FPGAs that are optimized for data and compute-intensive workloads like genomics, multimedia processing, network security and cloud-based video broadcasting. Every major cloud provider is deep in development on Turin programs with a steady stream of public instances and internal deployments expected to ramp into production over the coming quarters. Enterprise adoption of EPYC instances was very strong in the quarter. The number of EPYC-powered cloud instances activated by Forbes 2000 enterprise customers more than doubled year-over-year, including new wins with Internet native streaming, transportation, financial services, and social media companies. For example, CrowdStrike achieved major performance in cost improvements by broadly deploying EPYC instances across its multi- cloud infrastructure. At the same time, we're also actively partnering with leading application and cloud providers to deploy EPYC-optimized solutions tailored for specialized industry verticals. Siemens launched their latest software- defined vehicle solution powered by EPYC CPUs and Radeon Pro GPUs on Azure, leveraging digital twin technology to significantly speed up automotive design and validation. Oracle launched a new version of its Exadata database platform, which is used by more than half of the Fortune Global 100. The latest Exadata X11M has been optimized for 5th Gen EPYC processors to deliver up to 25% faster performance in transaction processing and analytics compared to the prior generation. Turning to enterprise on-prem adoption. EPYC CPU sales grew by a large double-digit percentage year-over-year for the seventh straight quarter driven by new public sector wins and high-volume deployments with large automotive, semiconductor, financial services, retail, energy, and technology companies. We have built significant enterprise momentum over the last few years as our partners expanded the number of EPYC-based platforms to more than 450 and we scaled our joint go-to-market programs. As a result, EPYC is now deployed by all of the top 10 telecom, aerospace, and semiconductor companies, 9 out of the top 10 automotive, 7 out of the top 10 manufacturing, and 6 out of the top 10 energy companies on the Forbes 2000. We expect enterprise adoption to accelerate over the coming quarters as more than 150 Turin platforms become broadly available from Dell, Cisco, HPE, Lenovo, Super Micro and others. Looking forward, we see a clear path to continued share gains as customers ramp their 5th Gen EPYC offerings that deliver unmatched performance, efficiency and TCO across every major cloud and enterprise data center workload. We passed key milestones in April to begin manufacturing 5th Gen EPYC at TSMC's new Arizona fab, with first production shipments expected in the second half of 2025. Longer term, we announced our next-gen EPYC Venice processors, our lead HPC products for TSMC's 2-nanometer process node. Venice silicon is in our labs and performing well with bring-up and validation progressing to support a 2026 launch. Turning to our Data Center AI business. Revenue increased by a significant double-digit percentage year-over-year as MI325X shipments ramped to support new enterprise and cloud deployments. More than 35 MI300 Series platforms are in production from all the leading service providers, supporting the expanding number of Instinct GPU deployments with cloud, enterprise and AI customers. Several hyperscalers expanded their use of Instinct accelerators to cover an increasing range of generative AI search, ranking and recommendation use cases. We also added multiple Tier 1 cloud and enterprise customers in the quarter, including one of the largest frontier model developers that is now using Instinct GPUs to serve a significant portion of their daily inference traffic. The depth and breadth of our customer engagements continues to expand as breakthroughs in large-scale AI models like OpenAI's o3 and DeepSeek's R1 drive increased demand for traditional inferencing and increasingly, as a critical part of pretraining. The industry-leading memory capacity and bandwidth of our Instinct portfolio is ideally suited for these workloads, and we are actively working with multiple customers to scale Instinct from single-node deployments to distributed inferencing clusters. Training engagements also ramped in the quarter as multiple Tier 1 hyperscale, AI and enterprise customers scaled Instinct GPU clusters to train internal and frontier models. In parallel, we're making meaningful progress with sovereign AI deployments as countries expand investments to establish domestic nation-scale AI infrastructure. In February, we announced a strategic partnership with G42 to build one of France's most powerful AI compute facilities powered by Instinct accelerators. On the AI software front, we significantly accelerated our release cadence in the first quarter, shifting from quarterly ROCm updates to delivering ready to deploy training and inferencing containers on a biweekly basis that include performance optimizations and support for the latest libraries, kernels and algorithms. We expanded our open source community enablement in the quarter, making significantly more Instinct compute infrastructure available to enable developers to automatically build, test, and deploy updates to ROCm code nightly. As a result, more than 2 million models on Hugging Face now run out of the box on AMD. We're also enabling an increasing number of models to launch with Day Zero support for Instinct accelerators, including Meta's Llama 4, Google's Gemma 3, and DeepSeek's R1 models that were released in the first quarter. Beyond launch, we are delivering regular software updates that increase performance for new models. For example, in the weeks following the launch of DeepSeek's R1 model, we introduced ROCm optimizations that enabled MI300 to deliver leadership inferencing throughput. We released ROCm 6.4 in the quarter with major upgrades that increased training and inferencing performance across popular AI frameworks like PyTorch, JAX and vLLM. The release also adds multiple ease-of-use features, including new cluster management tools that simplify the scaling and optimization of large-scale Instinct deployments. Turning to our AI solutions capabilities. Earlier this quarter, we completed our acquisition of ZT Systems, adding world-class systems design expertise to complement our silicon and software leadership. With ZT, we can provide ready-to-deploy rack-level AI solutions based on industry standards built with AMD CPUs, GPUs and networking, reducing deployment time for hyperscalers and accelerating time to market for OEM and ODM partners. The team is fully engaged and already co-designing with key customers and rack-level designs optimized for our upcoming MI400 series and working with customers and OEM partners to accelerate time to market for our MI350 series. We have received significant interest in ZT's manufacturing business and expect to announce a strategic partner shortly. We began sampling our next-gen MI350 series with multiple customers in the first quarter and remain on track to begin accelerated production by midyear. MI350 Series performance is very strong based on the advances in our CDNA 4 architecture. We designed CDNA 4 to deliver leadership performance across a wide range of AI workloads, increasing memory capacity and bandwidth 1.5x, adding support for new data types and improving network efficiency to deliver 35x higher throughput and performance compared to MI300x. Customer interest in the MI350 Series is very strong, setting the stage for broad deployment in the second half of this year. As one example, we are partnering with Oracle to deploy a large-scale cluster powered by MI355x accelerators, 5th Gen EPYC Turin processors and Pollara 400 AI NICs. This multibillion-dollar initiative highlights the expanding AMD and OCI partnership and the growing demand for AMD Instinct to power the next wave of large-scale AI infrastructure. Looking ahead, our MI400 Series development remains on track to launch next year. The MI400 Series is designed to deliver leadership performance for both inferencing and training, scaling seamlessly from single servers to full data center deployments. Early customer feedback has been very positive, marking a major step forward in our Instinct road map and significantly expanding our AI accelerator TAM as customers plan broader Instinct deployments to power a larger share of their AI infrastructure. I'm looking forward to sharing more details on the MI350 Series, future MI400 rack-scale solutions and the growing customer adoption of our Instinct platforms at our Advancing AI event on June 12. Turning to our Client & Gaming segment. Segment revenue increased 28% year- over-year to $2.9 billion. Client revenue grew 68% year-over-year, marking our fifth consecutive quarter of revenue share gains. We delivered record client CPU ASP driven by a richer mix of high-end desktop and mobile Ryzen processors. Desktop channel sell-out increased by more than 50% year-over- year. We set new sell-out records in multiple regions as our latest- generation Ryzen processors became the CPU of choice for gamers, topping bestseller lists at leading global e-tailers. To build on this momentum, we extended our desktop CPU portfolio with the launch of our 16-core Ryzen 9950X 3D processor that delivers significantly higher gaming and productivity performance than the competition. In mobile, AMD-based notebook sell-through was very strong in the quarter. We also saw strong demand for our latest generation AI PC processors as sales ramped, increasing by more than 50% quarter-on-quarter. The first notebooks powered by our new high-end Ryzen AI MAX+ and the first mainstream Ryzen AI 7 and 5 300 Series processors launched to very positive reviews. These new processors set the standard for traditional computing and graphics performance while also delivering unmatched AI capabilities in battery life, positioning Ryzen as a CPU of choice for gaming, ultrathin and commercial notebooks. Demand for AMD-based commercial PCs was also very strong in the quarter. Ryzen PRO PC sell-through grew more than 30% year-over-year driven by new end customer wins and an 80% increase from 2024 in the number of AMD- powered commercial systems from HP, Lenovo, Dell and Asus. We closed multiple wins with large auto, energy, health care, financial services and telecom companies in the quarter. Looking more broadly across the PC market, we remain confident we can grow client processor revenue well ahead of the market in 2025 led by expanding adoption of our desktop channel and consumer and commercial notebook portfolio as well as a richer mix. Turning to our Gaming business results. Gaming revenue decreased 30% year- over-year as higher Radeon graphics sales were more than offset by low semi- custom sales. While our semi-custom SoC sales declined year-over-year, console channel inventories have normalized as demand sales have strengthened for 2025. For PC gaming, we launched our Radeon 9070 series to strong demand as our new RDNA 4 architecture delivers leadership performance for mainstream gamers. First week sell-out set a record and was more than 10x higher than our previous best Radeon launch. Demand remains very strong, and we are working closely with our board partners to replenish inventory weekly and need to sustain demand. We also introduced FSR 4, our first machine learning-based rendering technology that delivers significantly higher frame rates and more immersive gaming experiences. FSR 4 is already enabled in over 30 games with support expected to reach 75 titles by year-end. Turning to our Embedded segment. First quarter revenue decreased 3% year- over-year to $823 million. Embedded demand continues to recover gradually. We expect improving demand in the test and measurement, communications and aerospace markets will drive a return to growth in the second half of 2025. We completed initial shipments of our cost-optimized Spartan UltraScale+ FPGAs and second-generation Versal AI Edge SoCs to meet growing demand for AI at the Edge. As a part of continuing to grow our Embedded x86 business, we launched our EPYC Embedded 9005 Series CPUs that deliver leadership performance for networking, storage and industrial edge applications. Cisco selected our new EPYC Embedded processors for their latest high-end firewall solutions, and IBM is using them to power its latest storage-scale System 6000 for performance-intensive enterprise analytics and AI workloads. We also released our latest Vitis AI software suite, expanding support for the latest models and accelerating Edge AI deployment across a broader range of applications, further strengthening our leadership in the rapidly emerging Edge AI market. In summary, our strong first quarter results and second quarter outlook reflect the momentum we are building across our business. While we face some headwinds from the dynamic macro and regulatory environments, including the recently announced export controls for Instinct MI308X shipments to China, we believe they are more than offset by the powerful tailwinds from our leadership product portfolio. Against this backdrop, we remain confident we can deliver strong double-digit percentage revenue growth in 2025 based on accelerating share gains with our latest generation of Zen 5 EPYC and Ryzen CPUs and Radeon GPUs and ramping production of our Instinct MI350 Series accelerators in the second half of the year to support an expanded set of customers and AI workloads. We also expect full year growth in our semi-custom business, and for our Embedded business to return to year-over-year growth, in the second half of the year driven by the reduced inventory levels and improving demand environment. To capitalize on our unprecedented growth opportunities and deliver our next major growth arc, we are expanding investments in our product and technology road maps, go-to-market initiatives and full stack AI software and data center scale solutions capabilities. We're also doubling down our execution to deliver and, where possible, accelerate our industry-leading road maps. We view the current environment as a strategic opportunity to further differentiate AMD as we deliver an expanding product portfolio that combine leadership compute and AI capabilities for data centers, edge, PCs and embedded end devices. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our first quarter results. Jean?"

      "text": "Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results and then provide our current outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. As a reminder, for comparative purposes, our first quarter fiscal year 2025 financial statement disclosures include the combination of our Client & Gaming businesses into a single reportable segment to align with how we manage the business. We continue to provide distinct revenue disclosures for our Data Center, Client & Gaming and Embedded businesses. We are pleased with our record first quarter revenue of $7.4 billion, exceeding the high end of our guidance, up 36% year-over-year, driven by 57% revenue growth in the Data Center segment and a 28% revenue growth in the Client & Gaming segment. Revenue declined 3% sequentially due to lower revenue in the Embedded and Data Center segments, partially offset by sequential growth in the Client & Gaming segment. Gross margin was 54%, up 140 basis points from a year ago. Operating expenses were $2.2 billion, an increase of 28% year-over-year as we continue to invest aggressively in go-to-market activities and in R&D to address the significant growth opportunity ahead of us. Operating income was $1.8 billion, representing a 24% operating margin. Taxes, interest expenses and the other was $213 million. For the first quarter of 2025, diluted earnings per share was $0.96, an increase of 55% year-over-year. Now turning to our reportable segments, starting with the Data Center. Data Center segment revenue was $3.7 billion, up 57% year-over-year, primarily driven by continued CPU server share gains across both the cloud and enterprise customers and strong growth of AMD Instinct GPUs. On a sequential basis, Data Center segment revenue decreased 5%. Data Center segment operating income was $932 million or 25% of revenue compared to $541 million or 23% a year ago. Client & Gaming segment revenue was $2.9 billion, up 28% year-over-year, driven primarily by strong customer demand for our latest generation Zen 5 AMD Ryzen processors, partially offset by lower semi-custom revenue. Client revenue was $2.3 billion, up 68% year-over-year. More than half of the growth was driven by higher ASPs from a richer mix of high-end Ryzen processors. On a sequential basis, Client & Gaming segment revenue increased by 2%, primarily driven by stronger-than-seasonal performance of our Client product portfolio and increased semi-custom product revenue. Client & Gaming segment operating income was $496 million or 17% of revenue compared to $237 million or 10% a year ago driven by operating leverage on higher revenue. Embedded segment revenue was $823 million, down 3% year-over-year. Embedded demand continues to recover gradually. Sequentially, Embedded was down 11%, consistent with our expectations. Embedded segment operating income was $328 million or 40% of revenue compared to $342 million or 41% a year ago. Turning to the balance sheet and the cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $939 million in cash from operations, and our free cash flow for the quarter was $727 million. We returned $749 million to shareholders through the repurchase of common stock in our repurchase program. We have $4 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was $7.3 billion. Within the quarter, we reached $1.5 billion of debt and issued $950 million of commercial paper to help fund our acquisition of ZT Systems, which was completed on March 31. Now turning to our second quarter 2025 outlook. As a reminder, in April, a new export license requirement was put in place for MI308 shipments to China, the impact of which is included in our guidance. We expect revenue to be approximately $7.4 billion plus or minus $300 million. This includes an estimated $700 million revenue reduction as a result of the new export license requirement. Despite this headwind, the midpoint of our guidance represents 27% year-over-year revenue growth. For the full year 2025, we estimate the revenue impact due to the export license requirement to be approximately $1.5 billion. Sequentially, we expect Client & Gaming segment revenue to increase by double-digit percentage, Embedded segment revenue to be flattish, and we expect Data Center segment revenue to decrease due to the exclusion of MI308 revenue. In addition, we expect second quarter non-GAAP gross margin is estimated to be 43%, inclusive of approximately $800 million in charges for inventory and related reserves. Excluding this charge, our non-GAAP gross margin would be approximately 54%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $2.3 billion, which includes approximately $50 million in OpEx due to the addition of the ZT Systems design team. The financials for the ZT manufacturing business will be reported as discontinued operations starting in the second quarter. We expect net interest and other expenses to be $5 million due to the debt associated with the ZT System transaction; non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13% and the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.64 billion shares, which includes 9 million shares related to the ZT transaction. Looking forward, despite ongoing macro and trade policy-related uncertainties, we believe the investments we are making will position us well to address the large growth opportunities ahead as AI expand the use of high-performance computing across all our end markets. In closing, 2025 is off to a strong start as we continue to execute on key strategic and financial goals. We delivered strong top line revenue growth, expanded gross and operating margins and closed the key acquisition of ZT Systems to expand and accelerate our Data Center GPU and the systems road maps. With that, I'll turn it back to Matt for the Q&A session."

      "text": "Chair, President & CEO Okay. Great, Josh. Thanks for the question. Look, we were very pleased with our performance in Q1. We actually saw strength across a number of our businesses. We saw strength certainly in the Client business, very strong desktop performance. We saw strength in our gaming business as well, which was really due to our strong Radeon launch. And we also saw some strength in our Data Center business across both stronger CPU and GPU. So those are some of the drivers for our Q1 performance. And in particular, on your question of Client performance, we've certainly looked very carefully at the ordering patterns and what customers are telling us. We have not seen a lot of tariff-related activity in that business. I would say, though, what we have seen is a real stronger mix and strength in our overall ASPs. So the desktop channel, which is an area where we have a very strong gaming products right now, actually performed well above seasonality in Q1, and that is really the strength of the ASPs there. So that's what we saw in Q1. And then to your question about the guide for Q2, as Jean mentioned, we do have the new export control limitation on MI308. So we have taken out that revenue, which is a $700 million headwind in Q2. But with that, we have a strong outlook given the strength across the rest of our businesses. So we continue to see strength in Client going into the second quarter. Again, the desktop business continues to perform above typical seasonality. We're also seeing the beginning of the commercial ramp, which is a place where we have traditionally been quite underrepresented. We see continued strength in Gaming, I would say, much better than typical seasonality. That is really our AIB business, with the Radeon products ramping. As well as consoles have now drained all of their inventory, and so they are starting their ramp into the year. And from a Data Center side, we see sequential growth on the CPU side. We see the GPU right on track minus the China export controls. And so for all of those reasons, we're pleased with where the performance of the business is right now."

I think the key point that we've always said about the Instinct ramp is very excited about the MI350 launch. We're right on track for that launching midyear. I would say customer interest has been very high. So from a competitiveness standpoint, we feel really good about where it's positioned. Overall, I think one of the advantages that we have with the MI350 launch is that, from a systems overall environment, it's actually very similar to the MI300. So we believe it's going to ramp fast. And we already have a couple of deals that have been announced, including a very important relationship with Oracle in terms of the MI350 series for a number of joint customers. So we're excited about the overall AI business. I think we continue to see strength there. I know there are some uncertainties as it relates to tariffs and other things. But this is one of those areas where, from an infrastructure standpoint, there continues to be investment in AI infrastructure. And so with that, we would expect strong growth into the second half of the year."

Relative to your conversation as to where does it come out, I would say the vast majority already comes out in the September quarter. So think about -- Jean mentioned $1.5 billion. You would see the majority of it in Q2 and Q3 with very little in Q4. So we had always expected that the fourth quarter, because it would be very focused on the MI350 family, would be non-China revenue, and that's how it was planned."

One of the primary reasons we acquired ZT Systems was exactly to address this rack-scale architecture. And so from that standpoint, the closing of the ZT acquisition has been very timely. What we're doing right now is, together with our ZT design team as well as our customers' design teams and our own systems design capability, really actively planning what those rack-scale systems are going to look like. I would say the MI400 Series enthusiasm from customers is high.

So that's very helpful. But probably the largest impact has been in go-to-market. In the go-to- market space, we have added significant head count and capability to address end users directly. And with the use cases, I think some of the things that we talked about across industries, we're actually learning from each deployment and replicating that across many of the industrial partners. So overall, I think it's been a strong effort on enterprise. And we're really still in the very early stages of that. I would say we're still quite underrepresented in enterprise.

And so when you take out $700 million in Q2 and the majority in Q3, that is what impacted in Q2 and Q3.

If you think about Q2, excluding $800 million charge related to MI308, our gross margin actually is around 54%. So at the company level, right, the mix is less favorable because the Client and the Gaming business is growing sequentially, but we do have a few drivers to drive the gross margin up. First, as I mentioned earlier, if you look at our Client business, the gross margin has been improving because the richer mix of our latest-generation product portfolio, that really helps. And also secondly, within Data Center, when we expand the enterprise market share, we do see gross margin improvement. Of course, in addition, MI308 Data Center GPU gross margin is on the low end for our Data Center GPU margin. So that also helps us overall, when we think about the second half, we actually think the gross margin will improve slightly because Data Center continues to be a very strong growth driver, #1 growth driver, second half versus the first half, which will be partially offset by continued strength on the client and the gaming side.

And relative to the Q1 performance of Data Center GPU, it was down very modestly from Q4, which is what we expected. We did see good overall demand actually in the first quarter driven by MI325.

How much of that roughly is China because that now seems to be somewhat restricted for the U.S. companies? And then also kind of related to that, how should we think about these AI diffusion rules that I think there is an implementation date that is coming up on May 15. I'm curious what you have heard. So just sort of the implication of China restrictions and these AI diffusion rules on thinking about the addressable opportunity for you longer term."

On the China export controls, I think we always expected that there would be some amount of, let's call it, limitation on sort of leading-edge GPUs going into China. So that was factored in to our TAM expectation when we talked about $500 billion. So I don't think that dramatically changes the TAM. But what I will say is, on the AI diffusion side, what we're very actively working with the government, they're thinking through these rules, and it's a very fine balance that we have to have. At the end of the day, when we look at sort of the U.S. AI companies, we have leading-edge technology. We want to ensure that the rest of the world can really use us as the primary platform. So I think it will be important to work through the AI diffusion rules and all of that as we think about longer-term TAM. And we're certainly spending quite a bit of efforts trying to ensure that it's well understood, the importance of the overall ecosystem and having the rest of the world really adopt the U.S. ecosystem given our strength and leadership overall."

You're obviously very bullish on taking share. You talked about huge tailwinds from ASPs. But curious, when you put it all together, how should we think about traditional seasonality into the second half, particularly with the potential of some pull-ins here in the first half?"

      "speaker": "Lisa T. Su",
      "role": "Chair, President & CEO",
      "text": "Chair, President & CEO Sure, C.J. It's a fair question. Look, we want to be very clear that our Client business performance is primarily driven by the strength of the product portfolio. And it's driven by some of the desktop channel products that traditionally are not so well tracked if you look at sort of the IDCs of the world. We are planning for, let's call it, second half sub-seasonal given that we're off to such a strong start in the first half of the year. And that is what we're putting into our sort of internal planning number. So you wouldn't see necessarily typical seasonality since the first half is better than seasonal. That being the case, I think we feel strongly that, from a consumption basis standpoint, we see the data. So when we look at the Q1 performance, it was a very, very strong Q1 in terms of sell-out and consumption for our desktop business. And as we start Q2, we're now 4 weeks into it, we see those patterns continuing. So we're in an upgrade cycle right now. Gaming CPUs are usually repurchased when there are gaming GPUs that come out in new cycles. And I think we're benefiting from that on both the CPU and the GPU side, which is great. I mean, we're very happy with that, and we're ramping up production to ensure that we keep the channel full."

You talked about kind of trying to obtain partners. Is there a certain number that you're targeting? And then how are you thinking about kind of getting through some of the learning curve challenges of getting the rack-scale working with your OEM partners such that you can deliver that ramp in 2026?"

So I think the right answer is we're getting a very early start, and that's what we have to do so that we maximize the overall learning cycle that is required for rack-scale solutions. We are working very closely with a number of our hyperscale partners today to define those solutions and make sure that we're thinking about all of the various areas that could require work. And we're also working with our OEM partners who also have, let's call it, learned quite a bit over the past couple of months and quarters as other rack-scale solutions have been coming online. So I think we're doing everything to, let's call it, move ahead the learning cycle. And again, we have the benefit of the MI350 Series being a relatively, let's call it, not large lift. And so the focus on the rack- scale stuff is on MI400."

But we do believe that we'll grow year-over-year going forward, in Q3 and Q4 certainly, for us to do the full year with strong double-digit growth."

For my second question, I wanted to ask about kind of the trends in Q1. So you said Data Center GPU was down, I guess, modestly in Q1, as expected. But again, if I go back to your sort of double-digit year-over-year comments, I mean, it couldn't have been any more than like $1.4 billion in Q1 for DC GPU, and it feels like it's less than that, which means it would have been down at least 20% sequentially, maybe more, which also implies that the server CPUs in Q1 were up sequentially, which was also well above seasonal, similar to Client. I guess what I'm asking is, are those trends correct? Am I modeling that correct? And I guess, what are the implications in that case of server CPUs actually up well above seasonal in Q1 given this environment?"

I think when you think about the Q1 Data Center performance, it's declined 5% so it's a little bit better from a server perspective because it has declined sequentially. Same thing like Data Center GPU, like Lisa mentioned earlier, it did decline. So I think that is the overall Data Center performance. I think -- I don't know about your model, but that is how we really look at the numbers, how we think about it."

In industrial side, the improvement is less so, their inventory still among different customers. But overall, the trend, the demand pattern does improve. I think Q2, we did guide sequentially flattish. And I think we'll start to see Q3, especially Q4, you will see a year-over-year increase, especially in Q4."

That $2.3 billion include everything from ZT because we closed the transaction on March 31. I think when you look at the overall, our OpEx increase year-over-year, we continue to drive revenue growth to increase more than OpEx. Looking at Q2, at the middle point of our guidance, revenue will be increasing 27%, and we do expect the earnings per share growing much faster than the top line revenue growth. So OpEx side, we'll be very disciplined to continue to manage it."

      "text": "Morgan Stanley, Research Division One of the things your cloud customers have been talking about is this kind of growth in inference costs, the sort of reasoning models using a lot of inference compute and some tightness. Can you talk about that from AMD's perspective? Are you seeing that in your business? Does that change the focus that you have going forward?"

And there's also a move to more distributed inferencing. So I think that plays into our strengths. I think we have demonstrated with MI300 that we are an excellent inference solution, and that holds true for 325 and 350 Series as well. So we continue to see with our memory bandwidth and memory capacity advantages, that's a positive. I will say that as we're going into this, the number of workloads that we're seeing overall is expanding. So we're seeing both training and inferencing as important workloads that we're working on and our customers continue to demonstrate. I think the desire that we're seeing probably from a trend standpoint is that there are many models that people are using today. So they're not necessarily using 1 model. They're actually using several different models and the optimizations around that are the things that we're doing with our ROCm software suite."

I think one of the primary aspects as we've talked about the $500 billion TAM and the opportunities there, look, we think ASICs have a place. We happen to think GPUs have a larger piece of that because the models are changing so much. And from our standpoint, it's really important to have competitive TCO. And people want choice to get there, especially as inference costs become so important, and we're working on trying to expand the overall inferencing sort of capability out there. So I don't think it's an either/or. I think it's, \"Let's get the best solutions out there,\" and we will certainly believe that we're very competitive in inferencing. And I think we are also becoming a much more sort of solution for training as well.
