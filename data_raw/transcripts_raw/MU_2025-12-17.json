[Operator Instructions]\n\n\nI would now like to hand the call over to Satya Kumar, Investor Relations.\nPlease go ahead.\n\n\nSatya  Kumar\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer\n\nThank you, and welcome to Micron Technology's Fiscal First Quarter 2026\nPost-Earnings Analyst Call. On the call with me today are Sumit Sadana,\nMicron's Chief Business Officer; Manish Bhatia, EVP of Global Operations;\nand Mark Murphy, our CFO.\n\n\nAs a reminder, the matters we're discussing today include forward-looking\nstatements regarding market demand and supply, market trends and drivers,\nand our expected results and guidance and other matters. These forward-\nlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause\nactual results to differ materially from statements made today. We refer\nyou to documents we have filed with the SEC, including our most recent Form\n10-Q and our upcoming Form 10-Qs for a discussion of risks that may affect\nour results. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the\nforward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future\nresults, levels of activity, performance and achievements. We are under no\nduty to update any of the forward-looking statements to confirm these\nstatements to actual results.\nWe can now open the call up for Q&A.\n\n\nQuestion and Answer\n\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Aaron\nRakers of Wells Fargo.\n\n\nAaron Christopher Rakers\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\n\nI guess my first question is, Mark, you talked a lot about being\nconstrained and unable to meet some of the demand out there. I know in the\nquarter you talked about kind of a slight increase in bit shipments of DRAM\nthis quarter. I guess as part of that, did the non-HBM-DRAM bits grow\nsequentially in this quarter? And how is your guide factored in between bit\nshipments between NAND and flash in this current quarter?\n\n\nMark J. Murphy\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nSo I think, Aaron, one thing I wanted to mention was we are doing all we\ncan to increase bit supply now. And we were able to provide additional bits\nto do 20% bit shipment growth in our fiscal '26. And we're doing that\nthrough efforts within an existing footprint and just efficiencies in the\nfabs. We're doing that with node transitions as we've said, 160 -- Aaron,\nI'm sorry, 1-gamma and G9 to get additional bits for DRAM and NAND. And\nwe're pulling in what we can on construction that will help us largely in\n'27, but we are able to provide growth what we think will be in line with\nthe market in fiscal '26 -- or calendar '26.\n\n\nI think we did have a very modest bit shipment growth sequentially in the\nfirst quarter. We expect a little bit more in the second quarter, but we --\nagain, a quarter primarily driven by price as it relates to revenue growth.\n\n\n\nAaron Christopher Rakers\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\n\nYes. That's helpful, Mark. And then as a real quick follow-up. As we look\nforward, I know you mentioned the 14-week period for fiscal 4Q, but how\nwould you have us think about the OpEx trajectory from here over the next\ncouple of quarters?\n\n\nMark J. Murphy\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nYes. I mean we've guided the second quarter. It will be sort of flattish in\nthe third quarter relative to the second, that will be up in the fourth\nquarter. And up and plus the additional week.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho.\n\n\nVijay Raghavan Rakesh\nMizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division\n\nGreat quarter. So just a quick question, Sumit, Mark and Manish. On the --\nwhen you look at the -- DRAM pricing is up pretty nicely, 20% sequentially\nand NAND was up pretty nicely, too. I was just wondering when you look at\nthe demand side, how do you decide to allocate capacity versus conventional\nDRAM versus HBM because it looks like the conventional DRAM profitability\nis improving very significantly. So just wondering how that reasoning --\nhow you look at that as you look through '26, '27? I have a follow-up.\n\n\nSumit Sadana\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nYes. So good question. I mean, we are in a very interesting environment\nwhere the aggregate demand for both DRAM and NAND is substantially higher\nthan the ability to supply to it, not just from a Micron perspective, but\neven at an aggregate industry level. So we are not really able to meet the\ndemand for customers across any segment. So all segments are short in terms\nof what they need from us versus what we are able to supply. And we are\nalso short on the HBM side, non-HBM side, all parts of the market. There is\na mismatch between supply and demand, and that continues for the\nforeseeable future because the -- over the course of the last few months,\nthere has been a very significant and pervasive step-up in demand across\nthe data center customer base. And so it has created a set of challenges in\nbeing able to meet the demand from our customers on a very broad level.\n\n\nSo in terms of allocation, I can't get into too much specifics. But suffice\nto say that we are working very hard to find the threshold level of supply\nfor all of our customers to minimize the impact to their businesses due to\nlack of adequate supply. And we are working hard to ensure adequate level\nof diversification in our business across segments, across customers, and\nfocus on our strategic customers when it comes to doing some of these\nlonger-term strategic deals that can improve foundationally our business\nmodel. So those are some of the things that we are attempting to do. And in\nthe course of all of this, our mix over time will tilt more towards the\ndata center, but we're also trying to remain focused on having\ndiversification across all the other segments of the market as well.\n\n\nVijay Raghavan Rakesh\nMizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division\n\nGot it. And then on the eSSD side, you're seeing a very strong pickup with\nyour QLC, Gen 9 SSDs as you mentioned, 122 terabyte, 245 terabyte. Is there\na way to kind of look at what is the attach rate that you're seeing now\nwith the SSDs on AI servers versus last year, especially as some of these\ninferencing vectors with reasoning and answer and all that starts to pick\nup? How do you see that attach rate growing year-on-year?\n\n\nSumit Sadana\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nThe attach rate is certainly growing, and these AI servers do need more\nhigh-capacity SSDs. They also need a significant amount of high-performance\nSSDs. This is where our Gen 6 SSDs have come into the picture. So we have\nbeen the first company to supply qualified Gen 6 SSDs to the market. So\nthat is gaining rapid market traction and contributing to our improved\nshare position in the data center SSD space. And then these high-capacity\nSSDs that you mentioned, Micron has the leadership position in QLC\nworkloads. And so our overall QLC bit mix is higher than the rest of the\nindustry. So that's an additional capability that we have.\n\n\nAnd if you look at workloads like KV cache, they do require a lot of higher\ncapacity SSDs. Now one additional thing that has happened is that beyond\nthe underlying growth trend of AI servers using more of these SSDs, we've\nalso had -- our customers not have adequate amount of HDDs as well. And\nbecause of that, there has been a lot of demand coming towards SSDs and\nconsequently, the ability to supply NAND to our customers has also been\noversubscribed due to a combination of all of these trends.\n\n\nMark J. Murphy\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nI do want to note that on SSDs that if you remember, our business was over\n$1 billion in the first quarter of '25, and in the first quarter '26, the\nbusiness did clear that. And as Sumit mentioned, as sort of the industry is\nable to get on top of the supply chain-related issues we expect. And given\nthe demand in that business, we expect that growth to accelerate through\nthe year.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America\nSecurities.\n\n\nVivek  Arya\nBofA Securities, Research Division\n\nI actually had 2 questions. First, back on the gross margin, I think you\nare at 68%. Is there reasonable way to think about what can be the path\nforward? Like is it 70%? Is it 75%? I know you have not given a specific\nnumber. But Mark, is there a way to logically think about where your\nmargins can go in the cycle because this is well above the prior peak? So\nis there a certain business model you have in mind? And the reason I ask\nthe question is because you have close to 70% gross margin, you're right,\nyour customers, NVIDIA, AMD are also talking about very high gross margins\nor expanding gross margins for their business. So I'm just curious to know\nhow you think conceptually about the path forward for your gross margins.\n\n\nMark J. Murphy\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nYes. They're -- we're at record-setting levels and that's positive. We\nguided to that. And there are a lot of favorable factors in that, that are\ndriving that. First is the demand driven by this generational change in\ntech with AI. And that's a multiyear build-out done by well-capitalized\ncompanies. So we think that's sustainable. And fortunately, AI needs more\nand better memory to perform better. So the underlying secular driver for\nmemory is positive.\n\n\nWe're just in a fantastic position with leadership technology, best\nproducts in memory and storage, and then we're operating really well,\nyielding quickly, cost performance is good, capital discipline is good. And\nthen you've got these general structural supply constraints. So when\ncombined with the demand from AI, data center to the edge actually. We've\ngot this supply shortfall and you see the price movement associated with\nthat.\n\n\nAnd this is a -- not in supply gap, that's not easy to address in the near\nterm given we can do with node transition, but you've got greenfield\ncapacity that needs to be put in place. You've got increasing HBM and the\ncapital intensity associated with that or silicon intensity associated with\nthat. And these are putting on earth, the most -- some of the largest and\nmost complex factories on the planet. So we need partnership to do that,\nand we're going to do it carefully.\n\n\nSo with all that, we do expect that margin can go up from second quarter.\nIt will go up on the basis of, we believe market conditions that should\nremain positive beyond '26. We believe it's possible based on our ability\nto deploy bits to premium products in which we're best positioned. And we\nbelieve that our cost performance is such that it will help us sustain or\nexpand these margins.\n\n\nNow just the math of being at these levels, for equivalent increase in\nprice, we're going to get less gross margin expansion. So there can be --\nas we mentioned on the call, on the primary earnings call, there's -- the\nincrease from here would be more gradual than you've seen in fourth to\nfirst or first to second quarter guide, but we do believe that margins can\ngo up.\n\n\nVivek  Arya\nBofA Securities, Research Division\n\nAnd for my follow-up, every time the customer, right, whether it's NVIDIA\nor Broadcom or AMD, every time they report, they seem to be upsiding\nnumbers for next year. So when you say you're sold out for HBM, does it\nmean that you don't have an ability to upside your production? Or does it\nmean that you're sold out based on the current level of forecast and you\nhave kind of unit and ASP certainty around that? I'm just trying to\nunderstand what scenarios let them continue to upside the numbers, unless\nit's just a share shift between you and your peers. Like if they continue\nto upside the numbers, can you help them do that? How much more flex is\nthere in your production for HBM?\n\n\nSumit Sadana\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nYes. So I think the way to read what we are saying is that we have\nvisibility to our supply. And of course, we're always trying to improve\nthat. But we have a good understanding of what our supply is. The current\nsituation, when we say sold out for HBM, for example, the HBM supply for\n2026, we have reached agreements on volume and price with our customers. Of\ncourse, if there are upsides to supply, we are able to -- very quickly be\nable to place that upside supply at our customers at good terms. But when\nit comes to the overall aggregate business, the demand on us is so much\nhigher than the supply, that even small increases in supply are not going\nto be able to make a dent in that demand. So we are more than sold out. I\nmean, we have a significant amount of unmet demand in our models. And this\nis just consistent with an environment where the demand is substantially\nhigher than supply for the foreseeable future.\n\n\nManish H. Bhatia\nExecutive Vice President of Global Operations\n\nAnd Vivek, I'll just add on HBM and DRAM because the whole market is short.\nAnd HBM production in fab output is shared with DRAM production, right, all\nin our 1-beta node. So this constraint is kind of across the entirety of\nour market, as Sumit mentioned, and as we said before, which is incredibly\nconstrained. So we are working hard to try to increase supply for DRAM, HBM\nand NAND. Yields are -- yields have come up really well for both our 1-\ngamma and our Gen 9, and those are going to be, as we gave color, the\nmajority of the bit growth for next year is coming from those transitions.\nAnd we're also going to have the majority of those -- of our DRAM bits on 1-\ngamma in the second half of next year. And Gen 9, as we go through the\nyear, will become the highest volume node for us in NAND.\n\n\nSo technology transitions are moving aggressively. We're optimizing and\nlooking to maximize production where we can. And I just want to point out\nthat we've also said that we expect HBM4 yield ramp to be faster than our\nHBM3E 12-high yield ramp was, which was already faster than our HBM3E 8-\nhigh yield ramps. So we're gaining confidence in our HBM capability at\nscale. So all those are things that we're continuing to work on, but just\nthe demand environment is such that it's really way oversupply, whatever we\ncan or what the rest of the industry can supply.\n\n\nOperator\n\nComes from the line of Kevin Cassidy of Rosenblatt Securities.\n\n\nKevin Edward Cassidy\nRosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division\n\nMy question, along those lines, if you're saying the HBM4 yield is better\nthan HBM3. What -- how does this work with the process node with the\nqualification time taking so much longer with HBM? Does this change your\ncadence for process technology? Do they stay in production longer?\n\n\nManish H. Bhatia\nExecutive Vice President of Global Operations\n\nI'm not quite sure of that. I think both our HBM3E and HBM4 are on our 1-\nbeta process technology. They both use the similar assembly architecture\nand process that we've had now from HBM3E 8-high, 12-high and now at HBM4.\nSo the reason I said that we expect our HBM4 yields to ramp faster than\nHBM3E 12-high did. Once we go to production in the early part of calendar\nyear '26 and start shipments in calendar second quarter is because of being\nable to leverage the learnings that we have, both on 1-beta for HBM as well\nas on the packaging and test side because we have common architectures\nbetween those products.\n\n\nKevin Edward Cassidy\nRosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division\n\nMy question was more on a bigger picture. Will 1-gamma get qualified for\nHBM4? Or will it always be 1-beta?\n\n\nManish H. Bhatia\nExecutive Vice President of Global Operations\n\nHBM4 is on 1-beta, and we haven't given specific guidance on how future\ngenerations will be, but HBM4 will be on 1-gamma. And the cadence of\nplatform -- I'm sorry, 1-beta. And the cadence of our customers' platforms\ncontinues to be rapid every 12 months. So we're just going to be focused on\ndelivering new memory -- new high bandwidth memory solutions for our\ncustomers on an approximately 12-month cadence. So that's not slowing down.\n\n\n\nKevin Edward Cassidy\nRosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division\n\nOkay. Maybe another question. Just how quickly can you change your wafer\nallocation from HBM to low power to high performance, I guess how far into\nthe process technology -- process can you change what the final product is?\n\n\n\nManish H. Bhatia\nExecutive Vice President of Global Operations\n\nSo they are shared process between the 2 -- between the various different\ndesigns that we have on a given DRAM technology node, but the design itself\nis unique. So when you start one design, whether it's a low power design, a\nDDR design or an HBM design, obviously, that's going to be the time frame.\nSo the real -- the answer to your question is that, basically, it's one\nprocess cycle time that we can change between any of these different\nproducts.\n\n\nMark J. Murphy\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nI think, Kevin, I just want to make sure it's clear that we have extensive\nplanning that we do around all the products and the product road maps and\nwhat products go on what node at what time. And there are a lot of factors\nthat go into that. Cost is not the only factor. And in fact, in HBM, it's\nsuch a complex product that's stability and turning quickly with the\ncustomer is an important factor. So there's some value in 1-beta and as\nstable and strong a node as that is. And then 1-gamma is available at the\nright time that we can use that node. Otherwise, we have plenty of other\nbit requirements that 1-gamma, we're ramping that as quickly as we can to\nget bit supply.\n\n\nSumit Sadana\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nI mean, generally speaking, we tell our customers that it takes us 5 months\nif they want to make changes, that use different die in the fab, 3 months,\n3.5 months to get to the front end and 6 to 8 weeks depending on the\ncomplexity of the product on the back end. So roughly speaking, 5-plus\nmonths of lead time. And customers understand that, they know that these\nthings take a long time.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Steven Fox of Fox Advisors LLC.\n\n\nSteven Bryant Fox\nFox Advisors LLC\n\nI just had one question. On the CapEx spending that you talked about on the\ncall. Are you giving any sort of sense for the breakdown between\nfacilities, equipment, construction, all of that, say, from -- and how it\nmight change between '26 and '27, that mix?\n\n\nMark J. Murphy\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nYes. We've not indicated anything about '27 other than that it will be --\n'27 total CapEx will be up versus '26. I did on the call, I believe,\nindicate that '25 to '26, the plans to -- our fiscal plans to roughly\ndouble the construction CapEx. And so that gives you sort of an indication\non direction of travel. Now we've got -- '27 will have Idaho 1 finishing,\nwe've got Idaho 2. We've got Japan, we've got a lot of construction sites.\nSo those are going to contribute to that sequential '26 to '27 CapEx\nincrease. And Manish, on HBM and Singapore...\n\n\nManish H. Bhatia\nExecutive Vice President of Global Operations\n\nWe do have a considerable amount of construction, I was going to say,\nSingapore as well, where we've got that, and we're going to be equipping\nour India assembly site, which is just now going from pilot production to\nproduction ramp in the beginning of calendar '26. So yes, there's going to\nbe a mix of growth in terms of construction CapEx to fund the mid-term and\nlong term equipment CapEx into existing clean room that we have right now.\nAnd then, of course, assembly investments for both HBM as well as\nconventional packaging that we'll be making as well.\n\n\nMark J. Murphy\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nYes. I'll just maybe add to this point. Tim asked about capital intensity\non the earlier call. We had CapEx as a percent of sales in the first\nquarter was below 35% that we talked about. And then on the second quarter,\nbasically, where our guide is to the -- both on the revenue and the CapEx\nguidance we gave you, you could tell it's in the mid-20s on CapEx as a\npercent of sales.\n\n\nAnd we've talked about strengthening free cash flow. So we're not only\nincreasing investment in order to get the bit supply, we are generating a\nlot more cash. We had near 30% free cash flow margin in the first quarter,\nand we talked about free cash flow increasing through the year. We paid\ndown debt, $2.7 billion of debt in the first quarter, bought back $300\nmillion of shares and went to net cash, all in the quarter, and it was a\nrecord setting free cash flow in the first quarter.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs.\n\n\nJames Edward Schneider\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\n\nFirst one would be just in terms of the capacity allocation question that\ncame up earlier. Maybe to put it in a different way, can you maybe -- I\nknow you're sort of a key supplier in many embedded and other kind of\nmission-critical applications, automotive and the like. Can you give us a\nsense about like a floor level, a minimum floor level that some of those\nsort of legacy or embedded applications would reach or not below in terms\nof production kind of given your importance in that market? Or conversely,\ncan you maybe talk a little bit about sort of what is the maximum level of\ndata center capacity or data center exposure do you feel comfortable\nhaving?\n\n\nSumit Sadana\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nYes. I mean I think there are a couple of things to keep in mind. First of\nall, the overall TAM is also shifting more towards data center, that's just\nhow the dynamics of the industry are playing out. So certainly, our\nportfolio and our mix is shifting towards data center. Our whole goal over\ntime is to keep mixing our products within each segment and across segments\ntowards higher ROI type of homes for our bits and for our output. And that\njust means that for some time now, the portfolio mix has been an important\ntailwind for Micron and continues to be a driver of our longer-term\nfinancial performance because we have, over time, shifted more and more of\nour revenue towards higher-margin products and taking a bigger share of the\nindustry profit pool based on that initiative. So that will continue.\n\n\nWith that said, you're right. I mean, we do have large share in automotive\nand industrial and several mission-critical applications. So we are making\ninvestments in our Manassas, Virginia fab in the U.S. to modernize it,\nbring 1-alpha technology, DRAM technology into that fab. And so that is\ngoing to be an important initiative to continue the support of long life\ncycle legacy products and we intend to continue to support them. Of course,\nwe also support a lot of these products and customers and segments from our\nhigh-volume fabs. And certainly, the demand environment and the structural\nchallenges on supply for us as well as for the industry just make it very\ndifficult to meet all of the demand for customers across different\nsegments.\n\n\nSo a lot of work that we are doing is to try and assess the threshold level\nof supply that each of our customers need, encourage them to also figure\nout other sources of supply in this environment where we may not be able to\nmeet all of the demand. Of course, we also continue to make sure that our\ncommitments towards our customers are kept. We are certainly very big on\nthat. So it's a delicate balancing act. It's a difficult environment to\nmeet all of our customers' needs. We're working very, very hard to do the\nbest we can on that front across the different segments of the market,\nincluding the ones that you mentioned.\n\n\nJames Edward Schneider\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\n\nAnd then just a quick clarification. Relative to the Hiroshima clean room\nexpansion you referenced on the call, can you talk about when that kind of\nwould turn into volume production capability?\n\n\nManish H. Bhatia\nExecutive Vice President of Global Operations\n\nSure, Jim. What we said is that we are working to develop and deploy next-\ngeneration DRAM technologies there with the support of METI and our Boise\nR&D team working with our Hiroshima R&D team. So it will be future\ngenerations of technology we'll be deploying and the clean room space will\nsupport those future technologies. So it will be timed to be able to\nsupport those -- the space needed for those new nodes.\n\n\nJames Edward Schneider\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\n\nBut not in 2026, to be fair.\n\n\nManish H. Bhatia\nExecutive Vice President of Global Operations\n\nNo, not in '26.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley.\n\n\nJoseph Lawrence Moore\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\n\nAlong the same lines, you had talked about the PC market could be limited\nby DRAM availability. How do you make those kinds of allocation decisions?\nIs it kind of just the highest gross margin is the focus? And how do you\nmake sure that the mid-tier PC companies kind of have enough that there\ncustomers when you need them down the road? Just how are you kind of\nthinking about balancing the allocation across these different markets?\n\n\nSumit Sadana\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nWith a lot of difficulty. Certainly, there are competing requirements. We\nare not just focused on optimizing gross margin. Of course, when we think\nabout pricing in different markets, we try to ensure that the pricing\nreflects the value of the product that we are selling. And so a lot of the\nmargin performance of different segments starts to get very close to each\nother in situations like this.\n\n\nWith that said, we have had customers of different sizes across different\nparts of the world for a number of years, decades, sometimes, and so we are\nvery mindful of our responsibility to them and we try to do our best to\nmanage the allocation in an appropriate way to ensure diversity across\nsegments, ensure that we are supporting our strategic customers and doing\nthe best to maximize our supply towards these customers in times like this,\nas well as to minimize any impact that could occur to our customers'\nbusiness due to lack of adequate DRAM or NAND as the case maybe.\n\n\nJoseph Lawrence Moore\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\n\nThat's helpful. And then just my follow-up. You mentioned a few minutes ago\npaying down some debt. I mean it seems like you're going to generate a\nreally large amount of cash here in the next few quarters if your view that\ngross margins continue to improve comes true. Just what are the priorities\nfor that cash over time, just between dividend, buybacks or other uses of\ncash that you might think about?\n\n\nMark J. Murphy\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nYes, Joe, the priority for our cash generation is always to reinvest in the\nbusiness. So we're going to make sure that we're investing in this case the\ncapacity we need to support the market and ensure that we're getting clear\nline of sight to return on that. And that includes, in this case, now\nlooking to strike commercial arrangements with customers that reflect the\nvalue of our products and our assurance on supply. So that's a priority.\nAnd also with that, maintaining the technology leadership that we enjoy\ntoday and that we intend to maintain.\n\n\nThe balance sheet also will always be a priority, and that's moving in the\nright direction. It was already strong and getting stronger every day, in\nfact, today, on this call, we're record liquidity. And we recently got put\non positive watch by one of the agencies. And we effectively have no net\nleverage now. In fact, we're a positive cash, net cash and our gross\nleverage is very low. Now we do have, on an absolute basis, more debt than\nwe've had historically. So we would expect to bring that down some.\n\n\nAnd then we would -- as we've said before, intend to grow the dividend over\ntime. And then repurchase shares with excess liquidity that we believe we\nhave. Now we repurchased $300 million in the first quarter. If you recall,\nI mentioned a couple of quarters ago, I believe that when we signed the\ndefinitive agreement for the chips program, our repurchases have some\nlimitations for the first 2 years. We've ended that first year. We're in\nthat limitation period in the second year. We are able to buy back some\nstocks this year, a little bit more than what we bought back in the first\nquarter. But then we're -- this time next year, we're largely\nunconstrained. I mean there are some requirements on CapEx and R&D, which\nwill -- we believe we'll easily be able to surpass those. So I think that's\nthe rough cut of the capital allocation.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Tom O'Malley of Barclays.\n\n\nThomas James O'Malley\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\n\nI just have one. Could you remind us as a mix of your CapEx this year, how\nmuch was construction CapEx? Or if you haven't given that, were trends on a\nnormalized basis?\n\n\nManish H. Bhatia\nExecutive Vice President of Global Operations\n\nYes, Tom. So we haven't, but we did say -- I think Mark did say that from\nfiscal year '25 to '26, we're doubling our construction CapEx. That gives\nyou some sense. We got...\n\n\nThomas James O'Malley\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\n\nYes, just looking for the base.\n\n\nManish H. Bhatia\nExecutive Vice President of Global Operations\n\nHigher than -- Yes. Yes.\n\n\nOperatorThank you. And ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our\ntime. So that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for\nparticipating. You may now disconnect.\nCopyright © 2025 by S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P\nGlobal Inc.

  "qa_text": "Operator\n\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Aaron\nRakers of Wells Fargo.\n\n\nAaron Christopher Rakers\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\n\nI guess my first question is, Mark, you talked a lot about being\nconstrained and unable to meet some of the demand out there. I know in the\nquarter you talked about kind of a slight increase in bit shipments of DRAM\nthis quarter. I guess as part of that, did the non-HBM-DRAM bits grow\nsequentially in this quarter? And how is your guide factored in between bit\nshipments between NAND and flash in this current quarter?\n\n\nMark J. Murphy\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nSo I think, Aaron, one thing I wanted to mention was we are doing all we\ncan to increase bit supply now. And we were able to provide additional bits\nto do 20% bit shipment growth in our fiscal '26. And we're doing that\nthrough efforts within an existing footprint and just efficiencies in the\nfabs. We're doing that with node transitions as we've said, 160 -- Aaron,\nI'm sorry, 1-gamma and G9 to get additional bits for DRAM and NAND. And\nwe're pulling in what we can on construction that will help us largely in\n'27, but we are able to provide growth what we think will be in line with\nthe market in fiscal '26 -- or calendar '26.\n\n\nI think we did have a very modest bit shipment growth sequentially in the\nfirst quarter. We expect a little bit more in the second quarter, but we --\nagain, a quarter primarily driven by price as it relates to revenue growth.\n\n\n\nAaron Christopher Rakers\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\n\nYes. That's helpful, Mark. And then as a real quick follow-up. As we look\nforward, I know you mentioned the 14-week period for fiscal 4Q, but how\nwould you have us think about the OpEx trajectory from here over the next\ncouple of quarters?\n\n\nMark J. Murphy\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nYes. I mean we've guided the second quarter. It will be sort of flattish in\nthe third quarter relative to the second, that will be up in the fourth\nquarter. And up and plus the additional week.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho.\n\n\nVijay Raghavan Rakesh\nMizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division\n\nGreat quarter. So just a quick question, Sumit, Mark and Manish. On the --\nwhen you look at the -- DRAM pricing is up pretty nicely, 20% sequentially\nand NAND was up pretty nicely, too. I was just wondering when you look at\nthe demand side, how do you decide to allocate capacity versus conventional\nDRAM versus HBM because it looks like the conventional DRAM profitability\nis improving very significantly. So just wondering how that reasoning --\nhow you look at that as you look through '26, '27? I have a follow-up.\n\n\nSumit Sadana\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nYes. So good question. I mean, we are in a very interesting environment\nwhere the aggregate demand for both DRAM and NAND is substantially higher\nthan the ability to supply to it, not just from a Micron perspective, but\neven at an aggregate industry level. So we are not really able to meet the\ndemand for customers across any segment. So all segments are short in terms\nof what they need from us versus what we are able to supply. And we are\nalso short on the HBM side, non-HBM side, all parts of the market. There is\na mismatch between supply and demand, and that continues for the\nforeseeable future because the -- over the course of the last few months,\nthere has been a very significant and pervasive step-up in demand across\nthe data center customer base. And so it has created a set of challenges in\nbeing able to meet the demand from our customers on a very broad level.\n\n\nSo in terms of allocation, I can't get into too much specifics. But suffice\nto say that we are working very hard to find the threshold level of supply\nfor all of our customers to minimize the impact to their businesses due to\nlack of adequate supply. And we are working hard to ensure adequate level\nof diversification in our business across segments, across customers, and\nfocus on our strategic customers when it comes to doing some of these\nlonger-term strategic deals that can improve foundationally our business\nmodel. So those are some of the things that we are attempting to do. And in\nthe course of all of this, our mix over time will tilt more towards the\ndata center, but we're also trying to remain focused on having\ndiversification across all the other segments of the market as well.\n\n\nVijay Raghavan Rakesh\nMizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division\n\nGot it. And then on the eSSD side, you're seeing a very strong pickup with\nyour QLC, Gen 9 SSDs as you mentioned, 122 terabyte, 245 terabyte. Is there\na way to kind of look at what is the attach rate that you're seeing now\nwith the SSDs on AI servers versus last year, especially as some of these\ninferencing vectors with reasoning and answer and all that starts to pick\nup? How do you see that attach rate growing year-on-year?\n\n\nSumit Sadana\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nThe attach rate is certainly growing, and these AI servers do need more\nhigh-capacity SSDs. They also need a significant amount of high-performance\nSSDs. This is where our Gen 6 SSDs have come into the picture. So we have\nbeen the first company to supply qualified Gen 6 SSDs to the market. So\nthat is gaining rapid market traction and contributing to our improved\nshare position in the data center SSD space. And then these high-capacity\nSSDs that you mentioned, Micron has the leadership position in QLC\nworkloads. And so our overall QLC bit mix is higher than the rest of the\nindustry. So that's an additional capability that we have.\n\n\nAnd if you look at workloads like KV cache, they do require a lot of higher\ncapacity SSDs. Now one additional thing that has happened is that beyond\nthe underlying growth trend of AI servers using more of these SSDs, we've\nalso had -- our customers not have adequate amount of HDDs as well. And\nbecause of that, there has been a lot of demand coming towards SSDs and\nconsequently, the ability to supply NAND to our customers has also been\noversubscribed due to a combination of all of these trends.\n\n\nMark J. Murphy\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nI do want to note that on SSDs that if you remember, our business was over\n$1 billion in the first quarter of '25, and in the first quarter '26, the\nbusiness did clear that. And as Sumit mentioned, as sort of the industry is\nable to get on top of the supply chain-related issues we expect. And given\nthe demand in that business, we expect that growth to accelerate through\nthe year.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America\nSecurities.\n\n\nVivek  Arya\nBofA Securities, Research Division\n\nI actually had 2 questions. First, back on the gross margin, I think you\nare at 68%. Is there reasonable way to think about what can be the path\nforward? Like is it 70%? Is it 75%? I know you have not given a specific\nnumber. But Mark, is there a way to logically think about where your\nmargins can go in the cycle because this is well above the prior peak? So\nis there a certain business model you have in mind? And the reason I ask\nthe question is because you have close to 70% gross margin, you're right,\nyour customers, NVIDIA, AMD are also talking about very high gross margins\nor expanding gross margins for their business. So I'm just curious to know\nhow you think conceptually about the path forward for your gross margins.\n\n\nMark J. Murphy\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nYes. They're -- we're at record-setting levels and that's positive. We\nguided to that. And there are a lot of favorable factors in that, that are\ndriving that. First is the demand driven by this generational change in\ntech with AI. And that's a multiyear build-out done by well-capitalized\ncompanies. So we think that's sustainable. And fortunately, AI needs more\nand better memory to perform better. So the underlying secular driver for\nmemory is positive.\n\n\nWe're just in a fantastic position with leadership technology, best\nproducts in memory and storage, and then we're operating really well,\nyielding quickly, cost performance is good, capital discipline is good. And\nthen you've got these general structural supply constraints. So when\ncombined with the demand from AI, data center to the edge actually. We've\ngot this supply shortfall and you see the price movement associated with\nthat.\n\n\nAnd this is a -- not in supply gap, that's not easy to address in the near\nterm given we can do with node transition, but you've got greenfield\ncapacity that needs to be put in place. You've got increasing HBM and the\ncapital intensity associated with that or silicon intensity associated with\nthat. And these are putting on earth, the most -- some of the largest and\nmost complex factories on the planet. So we need partnership to do that,\nand we're going to do it carefully.\n\n\nSo with all that, we do expect that margin can go up from second quarter.\nIt will go up on the basis of, we believe market conditions that should\nremain positive beyond '26. We believe it's possible based on our ability\nto deploy bits to premium products in which we're best positioned. And we\nbelieve that our cost performance is such that it will help us sustain or\nexpand these margins.\n\n\nNow just the math of being at these levels, for equivalent increase in\nprice, we're going to get less gross margin expansion. So there can be --\nas we mentioned on the call, on the primary earnings call, there's -- the\nincrease from here would be more gradual than you've seen in fourth to\nfirst or first to second quarter guide, but we do believe that margins can\ngo up.\n\n\nVivek  Arya\nBofA Securities, Research Division\n\nAnd for my follow-up, every time the customer, right, whether it's NVIDIA\nor Broadcom or AMD, every time they report, they seem to be upsiding\nnumbers for next year. So when you say you're sold out for HBM, does it\nmean that you don't have an ability to upside your production? Or does it\nmean that you're sold out based on the current level of forecast and you\nhave kind of unit and ASP certainty around that? I'm just trying to\nunderstand what scenarios let them continue to upside the numbers, unless\nit's just a share shift between you and your peers. Like if they continue\nto upside the numbers, can you help them do that? How much more flex is\nthere in your production for HBM?\n\n\nSumit Sadana\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nYes. So I think the way to read what we are saying is that we have\nvisibility to our supply. And of course, we're always trying to improve\nthat. But we have a good understanding of what our supply is. The current\nsituation, when we say sold out for HBM, for example, the HBM supply for\n2026, we have reached agreements on volume and price with our customers. Of\ncourse, if there are upsides to supply, we are able to -- very quickly be\nable to place that upside supply at our customers at good terms. But when\nit comes to the overall aggregate business, the demand on us is so much\nhigher than the supply, that even small increases in supply are not going\nto be able to make a dent in that demand. So we are more than sold out. I\nmean, we have a significant amount of unmet demand in our models. And this\nis just consistent with an environment where the demand is substantially\nhigher than supply for the foreseeable future.\n\n\nManish H. Bhatia\nExecutive Vice President of Global Operations\n\nAnd Vivek, I'll just add on HBM and DRAM because the whole market is short.\nAnd HBM production in fab output is shared with DRAM production, right, all\nin our 1-beta node. So this constraint is kind of across the entirety of\nour market, as Sumit mentioned, and as we said before, which is incredibly\nconstrained. So we are working hard to try to increase supply for DRAM, HBM\nand NAND. Yields are -- yields have come up really well for both our 1-\ngamma and our Gen 9, and those are going to be, as we gave color, the\nmajority of the bit growth for next year is coming from those transitions.\nAnd we're also going to have the majority of those -- of our DRAM bits on 1-\ngamma in the second half of next year. And Gen 9, as we go through the\nyear, will become the highest volume node for us in NAND.\n\n\nSo technology transitions are moving aggressively. We're optimizing and\nlooking to maximize production where we can. And I just want to point out\nthat we've also said that we expect HBM4 yield ramp to be faster than our\nHBM3E 12-high yield ramp was, which was already faster than our HBM3E 8-\nhigh yield ramps. So we're gaining confidence in our HBM capability at\nscale. So all those are things that we're continuing to work on, but just\nthe demand environment is such that it's really way oversupply, whatever we\ncan or what the rest of the industry can supply.\n\n\nOperator\n\nComes from the line of Kevin Cassidy of Rosenblatt Securities.\n\n\nKevin Edward Cassidy\nRosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division\n\nMy question, along those lines, if you're saying the HBM4 yield is better\nthan HBM3. What -- how does this work with the process node with the\nqualification time taking so much longer with HBM? Does this change your\ncadence for process technology? Do they stay in production longer?\n\n\nManish H. Bhatia\nExecutive Vice President of Global Operations\n\nI'm not quite sure of that. I think both our HBM3E and HBM4 are on our 1-\nbeta process technology. They both use the similar assembly architecture\nand process that we've had now from HBM3E 8-high, 12-high and now at HBM4.\nSo the reason I said that we expect our HBM4 yields to ramp faster than\nHBM3E 12-high did. Once we go to production in the early part of calendar\nyear '26 and start shipments in calendar second quarter is because of being\nable to leverage the learnings that we have, both on 1-beta for HBM as well\nas on the packaging and test side because we have common architectures\nbetween those products.\n\n\nKevin Edward Cassidy\nRosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division\n\nMy question was more on a bigger picture. Will 1-gamma get qualified for\nHBM4? Or will it always be 1-beta?\n\n\nManish H. Bhatia\nExecutive Vice President of Global Operations\n\nHBM4 is on 1-beta, and we haven't given specific guidance on how future\ngenerations will be, but HBM4 will be on 1-gamma. And the cadence of\nplatform -- I'm sorry, 1-beta. And the cadence of our customers' platforms\ncontinues to be rapid every 12 months. So we're just going to be focused on\ndelivering new memory -- new high bandwidth memory solutions for our\ncustomers on an approximately 12-month cadence. So that's not slowing down.\n\n\n\nKevin Edward Cassidy\nRosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division\n\nOkay. Maybe another question. Just how quickly can you change your wafer\nallocation from HBM to low power to high performance, I guess how far into\nthe process technology -- process can you change what the final product is?\n\n\n\nManish H. Bhatia\nExecutive Vice President of Global Operations\n\nSo they are shared process between the 2 -- between the various different\ndesigns that we have on a given DRAM technology node, but the design itself\nis unique. So when you start one design, whether it's a low power design, a\nDDR design or an HBM design, obviously, that's going to be the time frame.\nSo the real -- the answer to your question is that, basically, it's one\nprocess cycle time that we can change between any of these different\nproducts.\n\n\nMark J. Murphy\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nI think, Kevin, I just want to make sure it's clear that we have extensive\nplanning that we do around all the products and the product road maps and\nwhat products go on what node at what time. And there are a lot of factors\nthat go into that. Cost is not the only factor. And in fact, in HBM, it's\nsuch a complex product that's stability and turning quickly with the\ncustomer is an important factor. So there's some value in 1-beta and as\nstable and strong a node as that is. And then 1-gamma is available at the\nright time that we can use that node. Otherwise, we have plenty of other\nbit requirements that 1-gamma, we're ramping that as quickly as we can to\nget bit supply.\n\n\nSumit Sadana\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nI mean, generally speaking, we tell our customers that it takes us 5 months\nif they want to make changes, that use different die in the fab, 3 months,\n3.5 months to get to the front end and 6 to 8 weeks depending on the\ncomplexity of the product on the back end. So roughly speaking, 5-plus\nmonths of lead time. And customers understand that, they know that these\nthings take a long time.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Steven Fox of Fox Advisors LLC.\n\n\nSteven Bryant Fox\nFox Advisors LLC\n\nI just had one question. On the CapEx spending that you talked about on the\ncall. Are you giving any sort of sense for the breakdown between\nfacilities, equipment, construction, all of that, say, from -- and how it\nmight change between '26 and '27, that mix?\n\n\nMark J. Murphy\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nYes. We've not indicated anything about '27 other than that it will be --\n'27 total CapEx will be up versus '26. I did on the call, I believe,\nindicate that '25 to '26, the plans to -- our fiscal plans to roughly\ndouble the construction CapEx. And so that gives you sort of an indication\non direction of travel. Now we've got -- '27 will have Idaho 1 finishing,\nwe've got Idaho 2. We've got Japan, we've got a lot of construction sites.\nSo those are going to contribute to that sequential '26 to '27 CapEx\nincrease. And Manish, on HBM and Singapore...\n\n\nManish H. Bhatia\nExecutive Vice President of Global Operations\n\nWe do have a considerable amount of construction, I was going to say,\nSingapore as well, where we've got that, and we're going to be equipping\nour India assembly site, which is just now going from pilot production to\nproduction ramp in the beginning of calendar '26. So yes, there's going to\nbe a mix of growth in terms of construction CapEx to fund the mid-term and\nlong term equipment CapEx into existing clean room that we have right now.\nAnd then, of course, assembly investments for both HBM as well as\nconventional packaging that we'll be making as well.\n\n\nMark J. Murphy\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nYes. I'll just maybe add to this point. Tim asked about capital intensity\non the earlier call. We had CapEx as a percent of sales in the first\nquarter was below 35% that we talked about. And then on the second quarter,\nbasically, where our guide is to the -- both on the revenue and the CapEx\nguidance we gave you, you could tell it's in the mid-20s on CapEx as a\npercent of sales.\n\n\nAnd we've talked about strengthening free cash flow. So we're not only\nincreasing investment in order to get the bit supply, we are generating a\nlot more cash. We had near 30% free cash flow margin in the first quarter,\nand we talked about free cash flow increasing through the year. We paid\ndown debt, $2.7 billion of debt in the first quarter, bought back $300\nmillion of shares and went to net cash, all in the quarter, and it was a\nrecord setting free cash flow in the first quarter.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs.\n\n\nJames Edward Schneider\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\n\nFirst one would be just in terms of the capacity allocation question that\ncame up earlier. Maybe to put it in a different way, can you maybe -- I\nknow you're sort of a key supplier in many embedded and other kind of\nmission-critical applications, automotive and the like. Can you give us a\nsense about like a floor level, a minimum floor level that some of those\nsort of legacy or embedded applications would reach or not below in terms\nof production kind of given your importance in that market? Or conversely,\ncan you maybe talk a little bit about sort of what is the maximum level of\ndata center capacity or data center exposure do you feel comfortable\nhaving?\n\n\nSumit Sadana\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nYes. I mean I think there are a couple of things to keep in mind. First of\nall, the overall TAM is also shifting more towards data center, that's just\nhow the dynamics of the industry are playing out. So certainly, our\nportfolio and our mix is shifting towards data center. Our whole goal over\ntime is to keep mixing our products within each segment and across segments\ntowards higher ROI type of homes for our bits and for our output. And that\njust means that for some time now, the portfolio mix has been an important\ntailwind for Micron and continues to be a driver of our longer-term\nfinancial performance because we have, over time, shifted more and more of\nour revenue towards higher-margin products and taking a bigger share of the\nindustry profit pool based on that initiative. So that will continue.\n\n\nWith that said, you're right. I mean, we do have large share in automotive\nand industrial and several mission-critical applications. So we are making\ninvestments in our Manassas, Virginia fab in the U.S. to modernize it,\nbring 1-alpha technology, DRAM technology into that fab. And so that is\ngoing to be an important initiative to continue the support of long life\ncycle legacy products and we intend to continue to support them. Of course,\nwe also support a lot of these products and customers and segments from our\nhigh-volume fabs. And certainly, the demand environment and the structural\nchallenges on supply for us as well as for the industry just make it very\ndifficult to meet all of the demand for customers across different\nsegments.\n\n\nSo a lot of work that we are doing is to try and assess the threshold level\nof supply that each of our customers need, encourage them to also figure\nout other sources of supply in this environment where we may not be able to\nmeet all of the demand. Of course, we also continue to make sure that our\ncommitments towards our customers are kept. We are certainly very big on\nthat. So it's a delicate balancing act. It's a difficult environment to\nmeet all of our customers' needs. We're working very, very hard to do the\nbest we can on that front across the different segments of the market,\nincluding the ones that you mentioned.\n\n\nJames Edward Schneider\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\n\nAnd then just a quick clarification. Relative to the Hiroshima clean room\nexpansion you referenced on the call, can you talk about when that kind of\nwould turn into volume production capability?\n\n\nManish H. Bhatia\nExecutive Vice President of Global Operations\n\nSure, Jim. What we said is that we are working to develop and deploy next-\ngeneration DRAM technologies there with the support of METI and our Boise\nR&D team working with our Hiroshima R&D team. So it will be future\ngenerations of technology we'll be deploying and the clean room space will\nsupport those future technologies. So it will be timed to be able to\nsupport those -- the space needed for those new nodes.\n\n\nJames Edward Schneider\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\n\nBut not in 2026, to be fair.\n\n\nManish H. Bhatia\nExecutive Vice President of Global Operations\n\nNo, not in '26.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley.\n\n\nJoseph Lawrence Moore\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\n\nAlong the same lines, you had talked about the PC market could be limited\nby DRAM availability. How do you make those kinds of allocation decisions?\nIs it kind of just the highest gross margin is the focus? And how do you\nmake sure that the mid-tier PC companies kind of have enough that there\ncustomers when you need them down the road? Just how are you kind of\nthinking about balancing the allocation across these different markets?\n\n\nSumit Sadana\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nWith a lot of difficulty. Certainly, there are competing requirements. We\nare not just focused on optimizing gross margin. Of course, when we think\nabout pricing in different markets, we try to ensure that the pricing\nreflects the value of the product that we are selling. And so a lot of the\nmargin performance of different segments starts to get very close to each\nother in situations like this.\n\n\nWith that said, we have had customers of different sizes across different\nparts of the world for a number of years, decades, sometimes, and so we are\nvery mindful of our responsibility to them and we try to do our best to\nmanage the allocation in an appropriate way to ensure diversity across\nsegments, ensure that we are supporting our strategic customers and doing\nthe best to maximize our supply towards these customers in times like this,\nas well as to minimize any impact that could occur to our customers'\nbusiness due to lack of adequate DRAM or NAND as the case maybe.\n\n\nJoseph Lawrence Moore\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\n\nThat's helpful. And then just my follow-up. You mentioned a few minutes ago\npaying down some debt. I mean it seems like you're going to generate a\nreally large amount of cash here in the next few quarters if your view that\ngross margins continue to improve comes true. Just what are the priorities\nfor that cash over time, just between dividend, buybacks or other uses of\ncash that you might think about?\n\n\nMark J. Murphy\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nYes, Joe, the priority for our cash generation is always to reinvest in the\nbusiness. So we're going to make sure that we're investing in this case the\ncapacity we need to support the market and ensure that we're getting clear\nline of sight to return on that. And that includes, in this case, now\nlooking to strike commercial arrangements with customers that reflect the\nvalue of our products and our assurance on supply. So that's a priority.\nAnd also with that, maintaining the technology leadership that we enjoy\ntoday and that we intend to maintain.\n\n\nThe balance sheet also will always be a priority, and that's moving in the\nright direction. It was already strong and getting stronger every day, in\nfact, today, on this call, we're record liquidity. And we recently got put\non positive watch by one of the agencies. And we effectively have no net\nleverage now. In fact, we're a positive cash, net cash and our gross\nleverage is very low. Now we do have, on an absolute basis, more debt than\nwe've had historically. So we would expect to bring that down some.\n\n\nAnd then we would -- as we've said before, intend to grow the dividend over\ntime. And then repurchase shares with excess liquidity that we believe we\nhave. Now we repurchased $300 million in the first quarter. If you recall,\nI mentioned a couple of quarters ago, I believe that when we signed the\ndefinitive agreement for the chips program, our repurchases have some\nlimitations for the first 2 years. We've ended that first year. We're in\nthat limitation period in the second year. We are able to buy back some\nstocks this year, a little bit more than what we bought back in the first\nquarter. But then we're -- this time next year, we're largely\nunconstrained. I mean there are some requirements on CapEx and R&D, which\nwill -- we believe we'll easily be able to surpass those. So I think that's\nthe rough cut of the capital allocation.\n\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Tom O'Malley of Barclays.\n\n\nThomas James O'Malley\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\n\nI just have one. Could you remind us as a mix of your CapEx this year, how\nmuch was construction CapEx? Or if you haven't given that, were trends on a\nnormalized basis?\n\n\nManish H. Bhatia\nExecutive Vice President of Global Operations\n\nYes, Tom. So we haven't, but we did say -- I think Mark did say that from\nfiscal year '25 to '26, we're doubling our construction CapEx. That gives\nyou some sense. We got...\n\n\nThomas James O'Malley\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\n\nYes, just looking for the base.\n\n\nManish H. Bhatia\nExecutive Vice President of Global Operations\n\nHigher than -- Yes. Yes.\n\n\nOperatorThank you. And ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our\ntime. So that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for\nparticipating. You may now disconnect.\nCopyright © 2025 by S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P\nGlobal Inc.

And we were able to provide additional bits to do 20% bit shipment growth in our fiscal '26. And we're doing that through efforts within an existing footprint and just efficiencies in the fabs. We're doing that with node transitions as we've said, 160 -- Aaron, I'm sorry, 1-gamma and G9 to get additional bits for DRAM and NAND. And we're pulling in what we can on construction that will help us largely in '27, but we are able to provide growth what we think will be in line with the market in fiscal '26 -- or calendar '26. I think we did have a very modest bit shipment growth sequentially in the first quarter. We expect a little bit more in the second quarter, but we -- again, a quarter primarily driven by price as it relates to revenue growth."

On the -- when you look at the -- DRAM pricing is up pretty nicely, 20% sequentially and NAND was up pretty nicely, too. I was just wondering when you look at the demand side, how do you decide to allocate capacity versus conventional DRAM versus HBM because it looks like the conventional DRAM profitability is improving very significantly. So just wondering how that reasoning -- how you look at that as you look through '26, '27? I have a follow-up."

I mean, we are in a very interesting environment where the aggregate demand for both DRAM and NAND is substantially higher than the ability to supply to it, not just from a Micron perspective, but even at an aggregate industry level. So we are not really able to meet the demand for customers across any segment. So all segments are short in terms of what they need from us versus what we are able to supply. And we are also short on the HBM side, non-HBM side, all parts of the market. There is a mismatch between supply and demand, and that continues for the foreseeable future because the -- over the course of the last few months, there has been a very significant and pervasive step-up in demand across the data center customer base. And so it has created a set of challenges in being able to meet the demand from our customers on a very broad level. So in terms of allocation, I can't get into too much specifics. But suffice to say that we are working very hard to find the threshold level of supply for all of our customers to minimize the impact to their businesses due to lack of adequate supply. And we are working hard to ensure adequate level of diversification in our business across segments, across customers, and focus on our strategic customers when it comes to doing some of these longer-term strategic deals that can improve foundationally our business model. So those are some of the things that we are attempting to do. And in the course of all of this, our mix over time will tilt more towards the data center, but we're also trying to remain focused on having diversification across all the other segments of the market as well."

They also need a significant amount of high-performance SSDs. This is where our Gen 6 SSDs have come into the picture. So we have been the first company to supply qualified Gen 6 SSDs to the market. So that is gaining rapid market traction and contributing to our improved share position in the data center SSD space. And then these high-capacity SSDs that you mentioned, Micron has the leadership position in QLC workloads. And so our overall QLC bit mix is higher than the rest of the industry. So that's an additional capability that we have. And if you look at workloads like KV cache, they do require a lot of higher capacity SSDs. Now one additional thing that has happened is that beyond the underlying growth trend of AI servers using more of these SSDs, we've also had -- our customers not have adequate amount of HDDs as well. And because of that, there has been a lot of demand coming towards SSDs and consequently, the ability to supply NAND to our customers has also been oversubscribed due to a combination of all of these trends."

But Mark, is there a way to logically think about where your margins can go in the cycle because this is well above the prior peak? So is there a certain business model you have in mind? And the reason I ask the question is because you have close to 70% gross margin, you're right, your customers, NVIDIA, AMD are also talking about very high gross margins or expanding gross margins for their business. So I'm just curious to know how you think conceptually about the path forward for your gross margins."

First is the demand driven by this generational change in tech with AI. And that's a multiyear build-out done by well-capitalized companies. So we think that's sustainable. And fortunately, AI needs more and better memory to perform better. So the underlying secular driver for memory is positive. We're just in a fantastic position with leadership technology, best products in memory and storage, and then we're operating really well, yielding quickly, cost performance is good, capital discipline is good. And then you've got these general structural supply constraints. So when combined with the demand from AI, data center to the edge actually. We've got this supply shortfall and you see the price movement associated with that. And this is a -- not in supply gap, that's not easy to address in the near term given we can do with node transition, but you've got greenfield capacity that needs to be put in place. You've got increasing HBM and the capital intensity associated with that or silicon intensity associated with that. And these are putting on earth, the most -- some of the largest and most complex factories on the planet. So we need partnership to do that, and we're going to do it carefully. So with all that, we do expect that margin can go up from second quarter. It will go up on the basis of, we believe market conditions that should remain positive beyond '26. We believe it's possible based on our ability to deploy bits to premium products in which we're best positioned. And we believe that our cost performance is such that it will help us sustain or expand these margins. Now just the math of being at these levels, for equivalent increase in price, we're going to get less gross margin expansion. So there can be -- as we mentioned on the call, on the primary earnings call, there's -- the increase from here would be more gradual than you've seen in fourth to first or first to second quarter guide, but we do believe that margins can go up."

But we have a good understanding of what our supply is. The current situation, when we say sold out for HBM, for example, the HBM supply for 2026, we have reached agreements on volume and price with our customers. Of course, if there are upsides to supply, we are able to -- very quickly be able to place that upside supply at our customers at good terms. But when it comes to the overall aggregate business, the demand on us is so much higher than the supply, that even small increases in supply are not going to be able to make a dent in that demand.

And HBM production in fab output is shared with DRAM production, right, all in our 1-beta node. So this constraint is kind of across the entirety of our market, as Sumit mentioned, and as we said before, which is incredibly constrained. So we are working hard to try to increase supply for DRAM, HBM and NAND. Yields are -- yields have come up really well for both our 1- gamma and our Gen 9, and those are going to be, as we gave color, the majority of the bit growth for next year is coming from those transitions. And we're also going to have the majority of those -- of our DRAM bits on 1- gamma in the second half of next year. And Gen 9, as we go through the year, will become the highest volume node for us in NAND. So technology transitions are moving aggressively. We're optimizing and looking to maximize production where we can. And I just want to point out that we've also said that we expect HBM4 yield ramp to be faster than our HBM3E 12-high yield ramp was, which was already faster than our HBM3E 8- high yield ramps. So we're gaining confidence in our HBM capability at scale. So all those are things that we're continuing to work on, but just the demand environment is such that it's really way oversupply, whatever we can or what the rest of the industry can supply."

First of all, the overall TAM is also shifting more towards data center, that's just how the dynamics of the industry are playing out. So certainly, our portfolio and our mix is shifting towards data center. Our whole goal over time is to keep mixing our products within each segment and across segments towards higher ROI type of homes for our bits and for our output. And that just means that for some time now, the portfolio mix has been an important tailwind for Micron and continues to be a driver of our longer-term financial performance because we have, over time, shifted more and more of our revenue towards higher-margin products and taking a bigger share of the industry profit pool based on that initiative. So that will continue. With that said, you're right. I mean, we do have large share in automotive and industrial and several mission-critical applications. So we are making investments in our Manassas, Virginia fab in the U.S. to modernize it, bring 1-alpha technology, DRAM technology into that fab. And so that is going to be an important initiative to continue the support of long life cycle legacy products and we intend to continue to support them.

And certainly, the demand environment and the structural challenges on supply for us as well as for the industry just make it very difficult to meet all of the demand for customers across different segments. So a lot of work that we are doing is to try and assess the threshold level of supply that each of our customers need, encourage them to also figure out other sources of supply in this environment where we may not be able to meet all of the demand. Of course, we also continue to make sure that our commitments towards our customers are kept. We are certainly very big on that. So it's a delicate balancing act.

The balance sheet also will always be a priority, and that's moving in the right direction. It was already strong and getting stronger every day, in fact, today, on this call, we're record liquidity. And we recently got put on positive watch by one of the agencies. And we effectively have no net leverage now. In fact, we're a positive cash, net cash and our gross leverage is very low. Now we do have, on an absolute basis, more debt than we've had historically. So we would expect to bring that down some. And then we would -- as we've said before, intend to grow the dividend over time. And then repurchase shares with excess liquidity that we believe we have. Now we repurchased $300 million in the first quarter. If you recall, I mentioned a couple of quarters ago, I believe that when we signed the definitive agreement for the chips program, our repurchases have some limitations for the first 2 years. We've ended that first year. We're in that limitation period in the second year. We are able to buy back some stocks this year, a little bit more than what we bought back in the first quarter. But then we're -- this time next year, we're largely unconstrained. I mean there are some requirements on CapEx and R&D, which will -- we believe we'll easily be able to surpass those.
